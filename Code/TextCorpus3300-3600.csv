Don't worry, you can get a copy as well.""Is that even a real holiday? You are just making it up.""Um no I'm not, and it's not a ""holiday"", it's an observance. In 1988 former US President Ronald Reagan declared August 21st to be National Senior Citizens Day to honor senior citizens who made positive contributions in their communities. This day was also created to bring awareness of social, health, and economic issues that affect senior citizens.""Why should I care about old people? They are so yesterday.""We SHOULD care about and respect ""old people"" because without them, we wouldn't have all the technologies and conveniences we have today. Cities didn't appear magically; they were built by people before us through careful research, discussion, planning, and collaboration. Cars weren't grown and harvested from crops; they were invented by people and built by hands. Even that iPhone you are holding now is a result of someone's ""crazy idea"" - the same crazy idea that allowed us to fly in the sky, breathe under water, and travel to the moon. Without these people before us, we would not be able to live as comfortably and conveniently as we do now.""Ok fine, you got a point. But why are you doing this?""Growing up in Southern California, I knew very little of my paternal grandparents who lived overseas. When I had the chance to visit them, it was for a few hours over a meal with other family members. I barely got to talk to them or know them. One time when I visited my grandfather offered to take me and a cousin to an amusement park. I refused thinking it was lame. Shortly after he got cancer and became too weak to walk. Then he passed away.I will never forget the shame and regret I felt at his funeral. I wondered why I was so heartless and cruel to him that I wasn't even willing to spare some time and attention on him. After all, without him and my late grandmother, I would not be here today.I want to celebrate other older people in my community and thank them for their contributions. In this digital age today everything is about instant gratification and everyone is so absorbed in themselves and the next shiny thing that they forget where they came from, how they got here, and what they can contribute to their society. We have become mindless souls chasing after wealth and fame, trying to satisfy that materialistic hunger that could never be fulfilled. If we could just slow down, look around, think, feel, and appreciate, this world would be a much better place.""So what does this project entail exactly?""I have been photographing and interviewing seniors over the age of 75 years old in a way they would like to be remembered. My goal is to reach 50 seniors by August 21st of this year and host an exhibit showcasing their photographs and a brief explanation of their lives to celebrate their existence and contribution to the world. After the event I will produce a photo book containing everyone's photographs and life stories and print copies of the book for all participants to keep.Thanks to Palos Verdes Library and Palos Verdes Peninsula, they have been helping me to promote this event and offered the space to exhibit the photographs. However, I need help with funding so I can print and frame the artwork for the exhibit and produce 50 copies of the photo books for all participants to keep. These photo books will be high-quality, hard cover 8"" x 10"" art books that signify the importance of the people they contain.It is very important for participants to all receive a copy of the photo book so they can continue to be celebrated through this book. The seniors can also pass on the book to their families who can remember the seniors' contributions to the families' lives.Please help me to make this project happen. It's time for us to contribute to those who have contributed to us.","My primary concern is not being able to finish photographing all 50 seniors by August 21st due to time constraints. The exhibit will still happen on 08/21 even if I don't have 50 participants/photographs. However, I will keep shooting after the event until I have 50 to produce the photo book.My second concern is not being able to raise enough funds to print & frame the artwork for the show and produce 50 photo books that I promised to give to the participants.

Because without them, we would not be here today to enjoy everything they have created for us.This book features roughly 52 seniors of their life stories; what they have gone through, what they contributed to the world, and why they did it.In our current world of chaos, violence, and hate, it's time to be grateful and just appreciate.Growing up in Southern California, I was never close to my paternal grandparents who lived overseas. When I had the chance to visit once every few years, it was to have a meal for a few hours. One time when I was ten years old I visited my grandparents and my grandfather suddenly wanted to take me to an amusement park. As I did not know him well, I declined my grandfather’s invitation and said “next time”. Turns out, that “next time” never came, as my grandfather was shortly diagnosed with cancer then passed away. I will never forget the regret and guilt I felt at his funeral. I took him for granted. And now he was gone. Forever. Foregone, but not Forgotten was inspired by my grandfather, and my need to seek healing for a promise I could never fulfill. I started going around my community photographing and interviewing seniors over the age of 75 years old, requesting them to share their personal stories with me so I could get to know them, connect with them, and celebrate their life achievements and contributions.This book is more than just a photo book; it is a book that contains history, courage, risk, hope, and most importantly, will. It serves as a reminder to appreciate what we have, and to not take anyone or anything for granted.At each photo session/interview I also ask everyone a very important question in which the responses I believe captures the essence of each individual’s core principle:“If you had one message for the world, what would your message be?”This project has been exhibited twice and featured in the Daily Breeze Newspaper. Check out the article here:http://www.dailybreeze.com/2017/08/19/grandfathers-death-sparks-photographers-project-highlighting-south-bay-seniors/Each featured senior in the book will receive a copy of the book with my compliments.

They discover something terrible, a constant cycle of supernatural physical and psychological abuse by a monstrous undead father on his own resurrected family. As the situation becomes more complicated, and the secrets of the families resurrection are revealed, the spirits and Rebecca’s friends get picked off one by one. Rebecca realises that she needs to trust and help the spirits of the family in order to get out alive.Memorable characters, scenario and setting. A great project for a full team of camera operators, production designers, special make-up technicians and, maybe most of all, actors. The chance for 4 actors to all play 2 roles each.If you have any questions about the production, please ask away and we’ll be sure to answer them on the FAQ section.Please back the campaign if you love indie and horror films!The business plan is available on the kickstarter page. Check it out, and apply if it gives you the confidence in the idea it’s given us - here at October Town Entertainment!","Festival film, either limited streaming distribution or straight to DVD and Blu-ray, dependent of business of distributor. The production schedule is 10 days, and post production is 2 months. The full production checklist is completed.https://drive.google.com/file/d/19W3wPtz8M_fwdAN3084x3-vV4KdM7ZIW/view?usp=drivesdkThis plan includes:- The overview of what the film is- Storyboards, complete with shot list labels, lens parametres, blocking, etc.- The hours of the cast and crew. The outline of how long each member of the production spends on set each day.- The wages of the cast and crew.- The complete day-to-day shooting schedule. Designed to be an easy rundown of which scenes get filmed per day. Times and how long each set up will take.- The hotel and travel costs. Acknowledging that the best actor or crew member for the job won’t be living locally to where your shooting location is, most likely, a part of the budget has been set aside for hotel accommodation and travel.As far as travel, this is important to put in place because actors and crew won’t be needed for certain dates, so letting them go home in the meantime is preferable.The schedule has been designed around keeping cast and crew for blocks where they’re needed. Also taken into account are the hours they’ll be working and how tired they’ll be after the night shoots.With all this considered, the shooting period is still only 10 days.- Rehearsal: Often overlooked, this is the period where actors can work on scenes without being limited by the shooting schedule or production factors. This is planned for 3 short days, which is included in the travel and hotel expenses.NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLAN, but certainly prepared are:- A completed screenplay, 4th draft (Feb 2020)If this is a factor in your backer support, and you don’t mind spoilers, email me at jackh.park@btinternet.com and I’ll send you an excerpt.- The Shot list order. Every shot in the storyboard has a scene number and a shot number. Shooting with 3 cameras, to keep the production moving along and to keep the editing frenetic, this list has which shots will be filmed in each set up.This also takes acting into consideration, with attention given to which set up will capture the best performance.For example, the first set ups in many of the scenes will be wide shots, with extended close ups of hands, facial features, or anything needed to create a scary, intense scene. This also gives actors time to learn the blocking of the scene.The later takes and set ups of the same scene will be based around how the actors perform the scene, being more familiar with the material, location, and their co-stars.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tar-horrorhousehold/the-creators-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,tar-horrorhousehold/the-creators-feature-film,"Based on the true story of an internet community using it's power and influence to bully content makers, The Creators is a socially relevant narrative about 3 characters which encompass the key attitudes: Ignorance in business management, depression on the count of bullying, and the ego from a beneficiary (Chris Doors, Lillian Jensen and Zack Walker respectively.)The story is about Chris starting an internet character and business. As it becomes more popular, demand rises and he hires other contributors to be a part of it, including Lillian and Zack. Slowly, management errors and morally repugnant behaviour cause a rift between the creators and Chris, leading to firings and added pressure on those who remained. As Lillian struggles to keep her own video productions going, teetering on the edge of her mental stability, Zack grows increasingly arrogant and isolated, lashing out at every colleague and fan he can.As the story draws to a conclusion, Zack sinks into a stupor of laziness, Lillian snaps and starts behaving dangerously, and Chris' responsibly and control of his own company slips away.This feature film is based on, in addition to real examples of this happening, my short film Worm Quality, an older script which was expanded and re-vamped into The Creators. Worm Quality was shot during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown, and this next step, THE CREATORS was produced in adherence to the new rules. I'm so proud of Charlie Ison (Zack Walker) for his commitment in developing the role with such a small crew and tight schedule. Of the 3 main character segments of the film; Chris, Lillian and Zack, it's a huge victory that the 40 min Zack section is in the can, ready to go as soon as the others are shot when the actors are cast and the rest of the production gets underway post-chaos. This experience has been hugely satisfying as a low-budget filmmaker.The production will take place in Chicago, Illinois, in the Lawndale area to capture the tone and environment of the true examples the film is based on. Local actors and locations will be set up according to schedule, and any crew from England are accounted for as part of the budget.We're very much pushing it forward at a fast rate, having shot a large percentage of the script (139 pages total) already with Charlie Ison, the actor who plays Zack Walker, one of the film's 3 main characters. The film is being shot in 4K quality and has already entered production, if this is of concern for anybody. The professional format opens the film up for wide distribution to British and American film festivals and streaming platforms.The budget will be used for:- The wages of the cast and crew.- The hotel and travel costs. Acknowledging that the best actor or crew member for the job won’t be living locally to where your shooting location is, most likely, a part of the budget has been set aside for hotel accommodation and travel. As far as travel, this is important to put in place because actors and crew won’t be needed for certain dates, so letting them go home in the meantime is preferable. The schedule has been designed around keeping cast and crew for blocks where they’re needed.More than a skeleton crew and a more widespread audition process.The more FUNDING = OPPORTUNITIES for talent to work in the these troubled times.A physical release in addition to a digital one!A much faster turnaround time! With more organisers and post production collaborators, the faster the project gets finished.Director / Producer Jack Park is a video production professional with 4 years of experience in sports videography, educational content and filmmaking. Has an eye for organisation, preparation and detail.Director of ambitious and specific content, including short films Worm Quality, Red Paint, Bluebird and the conceptual trailer for Tar, a horror feature idea with ample opportunity to expand.RED PAINT - Short film: A colourful example of Jack Park's directing.Lead actor Charlie Ison is a trained actor in film and theatre. The change in location for the film was driven my his on-point American accent, which carries the location change in the sections we've already shot better than any filmmaking could. Charlie plays Zack Walker, one of the 3 key characters in The Creators.The Assistant (2020) - On the topic of sexual harassment executed in a stark, creepy way, this is the cold blast of relay that acts as the movies dark tone-setter.The Social Network (2010) - The way Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher turned the Facebook story into a Shakespearean back-stabbing tragedy is a key reference point for the way The Creators is structured.The Creators is also a launchpad for talented young people.Ed Wood (1994) & The Disaster Artist (2017) - Movies about bad filmmakers are a reference for what actually happens in The Creators: Poorly organised productions, Rowdy cast wrangling and creative vanity.Better Call Saul (2015 - present) - With The Creators focus on presentation, showmanship and sleazy business dealings, it has thematic similarities to Better Call Saul. As Chris, Lillian and Zack descend into erratic and impulsive behaviour, their enterprises fluctuate in success and income, and their actions become morally reprehensible.The dark story of various madnesses enveloping the characters will create great tension and excitement out of a grounded, relatable setting.CHICAGO NIGHT:","- Budget running over: The Kickstarter target accounts for this risk, but we're very confident in our money management abilities.- The EXIT STRATEGY is to apply for film festivals such as Raindance, Bolton Film Festival, Norwich Film Festivals, Leeds International - as well as some American  Festivals too. It'll be a positive experience project for every crew and cast member working on it, and the product at the end will be a professional piece that can be distributed on any streaming platform, anywhere.- This is a passion project pushed forward by collaborators who want to tell this story, with a great interest in how events like this have changed how media companies run and the  YouTuber culture as a whole.With all the difficulties of filmmaking, the movie will be made, That's a certainty.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/survivor/the-adventures-of-survivor?ref=discovery_category_newest,survivor/the-adventures-of-survivor,"The displayed video isone of4short trailers about the first book in the Adventures of Survivor/Survivor Evolution Series - Flames of Avasten. The story is about an autistic boy who is transformed into a powerful gold ribbon named Survivor. His mission is to save the world from an evil group of aliens called the League of Disease. The series was created by myself and my two autistic sons.  I have gone to great lengths to find the genius hidden inside my sons. Once I accomplished that goal, I designed a project that would interest both of them and at the same time take advantage of their newly found abilities. My son Kambel has the ability to paint and draw using any mediumwith the skill of a master. He uses his ability to create the characters for our book and animation series. My son Kantai has the ability to write and remember complex computer software programs. He is currently learning tocreate a video game for the characters of the series. I'm the writer, I put everything together so that it makes sense. We've published 4 books and created our own website www.theinspireweekly.com,and a youtube channel where we post videos to inspire and motivate those affected by any disease, or disability. We actively search for children with so called disabilities to become heroes in our stories. When a child is selected we create a digital image of his/her superhero character and they fight alongside Survivor against the League of Disease. http://www.youtube.com/user/KNSnetworkI am in the process of transferring my Information Technology college credits to Full Sail University. I intend to enroll the three of us in their online Computer Animation Bachelors Degree program. My sons already have amazing computer and animation natural abilities, with my help in the sometimes difficult academic areas we will earn our degrees.  There are a multitude of success directions for this project. Cartoon series, video games, downloadable DVD sales, ebooks, mugs, hats, t-shirts, toys to name a few. The Adventures of Survivor is a great motivational tool for kids everywhere disabled, or not. It's easy to see that our Survivor project could be used by hospitals all over the world as a motivational tool for children and adults. The survivor ribbon is already the most popular symbol of humankind's war against disease.  The Adventures of Survivor gives strength to the ribbon and the cause by bringing it to life. Our current goal is to improve the quality of our videos. To accomplish this we are in need of funding for new computers/software and adobe/microsoft software certifications to help establish production credibility. Currently we struggle with our production process because the outdated software and computers we are using increase our production time and severely limit our creativity. We are also in need of audio equipment to create original background music and voices for our many series characters.  Finally, YouTube has been a good marketing tool for us, but it hasn't provided the exposure we need. To make the Survivor series a success we are in need of funding to produce a professional marketing package which will include promotional items to present to possible investors. Our ultimate goal is to produce a cartoon series and video games that will reach worldwide.I started The Adventures of Survivor project hoping to find clues to the mystery of autism, but during my search I discovered something truly amazing. Autism is a phenomenon more complex than I could have imagined. To unlock its many mysteries would mean opening a new world for those affected by the so called disorder. I have published articles to share what I have learned during my search for answers about autism, but I know that's not enough. When funded the Survivor project will deliver a continuous motivational message through a creative animated series by bringing to life the worlds most powerful symbol of hope, the Survivor ribbon.","Dealing with the constant changing emotions of autistic children is very challenging, especially as boys turn into young men.  When I designed this project I successfully incorporated learning tools into the process.  As we continue to create new stories in our books and animations, we use our experiences as an autistic family to guide us.  Together we actively find solutions to obstacles and then use those solutions as key points in our stories.  Each setback presents a challenge to create a new story.  We are motivated by our hope that our solutions can be used by others suffering from the challenges of physical and mental disabilities/disorders.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/survivor/flames-of-avasten?ref=discovery_category_newest,survivor/flames-of-avasten,"Initially we wanted to create short trailers to advertise our ebook series, but as we progressed it became clear that we could do much more. We've set our sights higher with hope that we may play a more significant role in changing the face of autism.Flames of Avasten is a feature length animated film based on a published ebook series called Survivor Evolution. The series was created by two autistic brothers. It is a combination of the amazing hidden talents found inside their autism. You can find more information on the brothers by visiting  The Inspire Weekly. The film tells the story of an autistic boy named Billy Reynolds who is transformed into a powerful gold ribbon named Survivor. Billy struggles with his autism and the death of his father while trying to figure out why he's been changed into a ribbon. While trying to find answers his mission suddenly becomes clear as an evil group of aliens called the League of Disease begin to attack him. The members of the League come from the same realm as Survivor. Each has the ability to spread a specific disease and their goal is to destroy the human race. They have sensed the power behind Billy's transformation and know that with his ability to heal any disease Survivor has come to earth to stop them.Rupert Richards Nickname Roop: The legend says that Rupert Richcards is the oldest autistic man alive. He hides on an abandoned block where he broadcasts a motivational message that only autistic people can hear.Sneak Peek is an inside look at some of the characters and art work that you'll see in our film. We will periodically add exciting character posses throughout the duration of project funding. All pictures are available as reward posters and on other select backer rewards.Peek of the week: From behind the stormy sky a huge beast emerges, his rage so intense it terrifies even the hero created to stop him.       The KNS Network would like to recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month by displaying our version of the pink survivor ribbon. Pink Survivor is a sneak peek at the future of our series.In order to produce a quality film we desperately need new computers and software, Currently we struggle with our pre-production process because of outdated equipment which increases our production time and severely limits our creativity.  We also need audio equipment to create original background music, original voices, and voice over sequences for our many series characters. $10,000 Pre-production funding will used for: Computers, printers, scanners, audio equipment, and software.  Currently we are using media outlets such as YouTube to show our work, but we've had limited success. We have come to the conclusion that we need professional marketing services so that our film will eventually have worldwide exposure. Other post-production projects will include distribution of promotional items first.to organizations that fall in line with the message of the Survivor ribbon. Primarily institutions that support cures for disease. As word of Survivor spreads so will the distribution process.  $7,000 Post production funding will be used for: The creation of a 12"" clothed Survivor action figure to be used as a marketing sample and backer reward, promotional items such as DVDs, hats, t-shirts, mugs, and professional marketing services. I went to great lengths to find the genius hidden inside my sons. Once that was accomplished, I designed a project that would interest both of them and at the same time take advantage of their newly found abilities. Kambel Smith has the ability to paint and draw using any medium with the skill of a master, he uses his ability to create the characters for the Survivor Evolution Series. Kantai Smith creates the storyline and together they both design the stories action sequences, Kantai also has the ability to write and remember complex computer software programs, he is currently learning to create a video game for the series. Then there's me Lonnie Smith,  I'm the writer, I put everything together so that it makes sense. We've published 4 books: Flame of Avasten, The Infinite Power of Evolution, The Roman Cleric, and Survivor vs Lungar, along with our information website. We also created a YouTube Channel where we post videos to inspire and motivate those affected by disease, or disability. The KNS Network   We actively search for children with so called disabilities to become heroes in our stories. When a child is selected we create a digital image of his/her superhero character and they fight alongside Survivor against the League of Disease.I started The Survivor Evolution project hoping to find clues to the mystery of autism, but during my search I discovered something truly amazing.  Autism is a phenomenon more complex than I imagined. Unlocking its many mysteries would open a new world for those affected by the so called disorder. I've published articles to share what I have learned during my search for answers about autism, but I know that's not enough. Flames of Avasten is a non-stop action packed adventure ebook, the film will be much more.  It will motivate and inspire the world while helping to give those suffering from mental and physical disease the will to survive. Your funding will help create a 60 - 90 minute action adventure animated film featuring the characters of our book series. Promotional items along with film trailers will be distributed during the months before the release of the film in the summer of 2014.To show our appreciate to our supports we have an array of really cool custom designed rewards featuring the characters of the film. Rewards are samples of a few promotional items which will be distributed once the project is funded. ","Dealing with the constant changing emotions of autistic children is very challenging, especially as boys turn into young men.  When I designed this project I successfully incorporated learning tools into the process. As we continue to create new stories in our books and animations, we use our experiences as an autistic family to guide us. Together we actively find solutions to obstacles and then use those solutions as key points in our stories.  Each setback presents a challenge to create a new story.  We are motivated by our hope that our solutions can be used by others suffering from the challenges of physical and mental disabilities/disorders.  I guess the best way to describe our challenges would be the words:  ""A constant exercise of focus."""

They usually come in the form of production. With a film like this, and that we are a nonprofit studio, there are always problems that arise in the form of lack of appearances by actors. I have seen this problem arise in the past. However, with this film I was very diligent with finding actors and crew who are reliable, and our schedule works around their everyday lives. So with this, we can create a strong and reliable project. Another problem that could arise is the failure of equipment. Through every pledge we will receive we will be able to have bigger and better cameras and other forms of equipment. Our equipment has been used in every project we have, but there is still a risk of damage. This campaign will help us replace our outdated tech with brand new and fancier ones. The biggest problem I believe that we could face is failing to be there to thank our pledges. However, it is my responsibility that that does not occur. I will be sure that every pledge is met with what they deserve. I promise you we will not disappoint."

We invite you to participate.Sojourner Truth was an illiterate slave bornin the waning years of the 18th century in New York State. She was boughtand sold several times, subjected to the harshest cruelty anddeprivation. She lost her family, her children, and her husband to forcedsales to other landowners. Yet this remarkable woman would mount acrusade for women’s rights and the abolition of slavery that would not bequenched or limited by bitterness, her illiteracy or her station in life. She would go on to be a nationallyrecognized figure and immutable force in the pressing social issues of hertime. She would in fact win a hearing with President Abraham Lincoln onOctober 29,1864. The two would share a warm yet meaningfulconversation. She noted from her recollection of the meeting: “I told him that I had never heard of him before he wastalked of for president. He smilingly replied, ‘I had heard of you many timesbefore that’.”There is a timelessness toSojourner’s message that transcends generations, wealth, geography, race,religion, gender, sexual orientation... a voice so powerful, an advocate sofierce, determined to give voice to the powerless, the under-served, to theignored, the “inconsequential”. She speaks of the will to overcome,to empower, to realize dreams; no obstacle is too big to bar one fromachieving fullpotential. This is themessage that resonates, that captured the minds and hearts of the“Sojourner Truth: A Journey Revisited” project team and will indeed captureyours. The Team believes that the completed,  full life sized sculpture of Sojourner Truth must be placed in  a community where monuments to civic activists,  specifically transformational women, are needed.  Sojourner transformed herself, her community, and her country, and continues to inspire succeeding generations. Unfortunately, this type of sculpture is generally non-existent or rarely seen. Therefore, we strongly feel it is important to give voice to a timeless message by providing tangible evidence for future generations. We are open to suggestions and solicitations for the desired location. If our goal is exceeded, we will assist with costs associated with installation of the sculpture.WHO WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN?Manuelita Brown, renown andaward winning sculptor has carefully and meticulously captured not onlySojourner’s physical appearance but more importantly her spirit. Looking into the eyes of the bronze figure, they seem to lookback, reflecting Sojourner’s fierce determination, grace, singleness ofpurpose, yet tempered with love and compassion.Manuelita is the commensurate professional. Every detail is thought out before hand and executed from original conception to completion and final installation with only the highest level of quality acceptable. She has the innate ability to gather, inspire and coordinate with a team of dedicated professionals resulting in a finished piece that is a source of accomplishment and inspiration to all.

The project objective is to complete Phase One of a larger project to create a life-size bronze sculpture of Sojourner Truth. Creating the sculpture by the ""lost wax process"" is done in three major phases: 1. Sculpting; 2. Mold-making, wax-casting and wax-chasing; and 3. Casting [bronze pour] and patination.  Phase One includes: A. Sculpting a maquette [small scale model],  B. Building an armature [a steel or wooden skeleton or framework that supports the sculpture while the artist works on it], and C. Sculpting the life-size in clay. At the conclusion of Phase One, the sculpture is exactly as it will be at the end of the process only in a different medium—clay.  Phase One is already underway. The maquette already exists and is shown below and in the video. We seek your pledges to build the armature and secure the supplies and additional labor required for sculpting the full-scale statue.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raindogfarm/rain-dog-farm?ref=discovery_category_newest,raindogfarm/rain-dog-farm,"My name is Charlie Wainger. I'm from Redmond, WA, roughly twenty miles east of Seattle. For the last eight years I've been working with local food production.I started working local co-op's, then managed an urban farm & feed company, and started my own farm at Hidden Valley Camp. Now I'm looking at my families' land in a whole new way. I will create a high yield neighborhood farm to supply local restaurants and a CSA program. Through the years I've formed relationships with restaurants who are excited to use Rain Dog Farm produce, proving there is not only a market for local food in Seattle, and neighboring towns, there is a demand.My families' beautiful two acre plot is ideal for Rain Dog Farm. The land is a south facing slope with access to a well and ample sunlight. I'll be in the heart of a booming neighborhood and six miles from downtown Redmond, WA where restaurants have a local food focus.I'm interested in preserving the natural beauty of my growing city. The woods I used to ride my bicycle through as a child are now large developments and I want to provide the farm experience for new families as an alternative to just grocery stores.I will follow an organic low till/high yield farming method mastered by Curtis Stone and Jean-Martin Fortier, two amazing Canadian farmers. These two farmers developed organic farming techniques grossing over $100,000 a year on less than a half acre.I have restaurants in Redmond, Kirkland, and Seattle ready to use Rain Dog Farm micro green and salad mixes.This season (starting February) I will grow more than 2,000 lbs. of salad mix (total for season) and 25-35 flats of micro greens (a week).I will eventually cultivate the entire two acre plot, but I'll start with 1/4 acre.I will begin with the following crops,By focusing on these crops the first year I'll have better control over quality and ensure the farms success for future growth and crop expansion.For the second season I will add radish, kale, beets, and a second greenhouse to grow tomatoes and basil, and eventually cucumbers and peppers.Five years ago I created the first organic farm program at Hidden Valley Camp. Campers helped harvest and prepare salads and other vegetable dishes for 125 campers and 50 staff daily.During this time I learned children have more of an afffinity toward vegetables than an aversion. My goal, along with creating a viable business, is for the farm to be accessible for local youth. They will be able to visit a working farm and not only eat the great food, but see it grow.The funds I recieve through my campaign will purchase the farms infrastructure.After the purchase of these materials Rain Dog Farm can begin producing vegetables March 1st, 2018.Thank you.Film & Music by Charlie Wainger","I'm permitted and ready to begin Rain Dog Farm as soon as my campaign goal is met.Weather may delay certain tasks, such as leveling out a few areas of the growing space and the greenhouse construction. Once this is accomplished seedlings can begin to germinate in the heated greenhouse and the beds in the field can start to take shape.In April when the first harvest is available restaurants will receive Rain Dog Farm produce. From here I can gauge the demand of each restaurant and see what is available for the first season of the CSA.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raindogfarm/rain-dog-farm-expansion?ref=discovery_category_newest,raindogfarm/rain-dog-farm-expansion,"RAIN DOG FARMMy name is Charlie Wainger - I own and work as head grower of Rain Dog Farm. In 2018 I built a small greenhouse on my families property in Redmond, WA and began growing microgreens for two local chefs. 15 months later I work with over 16 restaurants. During this time I have cultivated a portion of our two acre field to grow salad greens and edible flowers. Currently the greenhouse, which I had to double in size, produces over 150 trays of microgreens per week.Almost 80 pounds of salad greens are sold weekly.Now I look to you and your donation to upgrade the farm to meet demand for Rain Dog product.Visit raindogfarm.com for a full list of restaurants I work with and follow on Instagram @rain_dog_farm to see more photos of the current operation.THE UPGRADEFirst things first, the power to the farm must be upgraded ($5,000) and new electrical work to accommodate the expansion - along with a tap into the homes water line to allow easy water access for the two indoor grow operations and field irrigation ($800). The property is currently at its max amp use and I can't move forward without this upgrade.Once these changes are made Rain Dog can operate for 2-3 years without further major construction. This means I can focus on quality while working on a functional farm.What the upgrade means for the farmThe shed upgradeI will convert this 10' x 20' shed into a year round indoor micro-herb facility.Inside can fit 300 trays giving Rain Dog the space to meet demand and hire an employee to take on further clients on the wait list. The cost for the barn construction ($5,000) is for insulation, lumber, heaters, lights, racks, exhaust, and fans.Edible Flower FieldYour donations will help cultivate the first in ground edible flower field ($3,000). This summer I experimented with five varieties of edible flowers. They were well receive by chefs and bar tenders. For the summer of 2020 I will till a large plot near the shed to produce over 20 pounds of edible flowers a week.CAMPAIGN BREAKDOWNElectrical Services $5,000 - power upgrade, electrical fee's, installation.Materials $5,000 - racks, lights, heaters, fans, etc.Water Line $800Construction $5,000 - lumber, soil, tractor rental, tables, etc.Kickstarter Fee's (roughly) $2000STRETCH GOALSIf campaign funds exceed $18,000 they will be contributed to the purchase of a shipping container to convert into a produce stand serving seasonal produce, chicken eggs, herbs, flowers, and various other products from local purveyors. The families around the farm can walk down the street and have access to fresh food.These are the main and most crucial elements to the farms future. But once the goal is reached there is still plenty of additional supplies needed; further donations are greatly appreciated to the kickstarter campaign even once goal is met.","There are little challenges in the way of project completion. Other than unknown speed bumps construction is set to begin October 1st, 2019"

Jag vill sprida kunskap om samisk kultur och upplysa omvärlden om de hot som påverkar renskötselarbetet. Detta projekt är ett informationsprojekt som förhoppningsvis ska upplysa omvärlden om hur det är att vara renskötare i dag. Det hela kommer att resultera i en fotografisk utställning med text och bild, även en rapport/bok kommer tryckas för att sälja på utställningen för de besökare som vill ta del av det kompletta materialet som samlas in. Tanken är att detta ska locka människor i alla åldrar, barn, vuxna och pensionerade. Syftet är att informera omvärlden om livet som renskötare och de hot som näringen står inför.MetodJag har redan påbörjat intervjuerna med personerna och framöver under sommar/höst kommer jag besöka dem i sitt arbete. Genom fotografering och inspelningar och nedtecknande vill jag fånga dessa personers livsberättelser, belysa deras situation inom renskötselyrket och den pågående kamp om att få sin röst hörd när det gäller gruvor, järnväg, med mera. Utvalda personer som medverkar i projektet: *	Anneli Kråik och Jan- Ola Jannok, renskötare på heltid -  Baste sameby*	Bertil Kielatis -  pensionerad renskötare, har varit ordförande i Sirges sameby i 26 år *	Lars Guttorm Blind - pensionerad renslaktare och styckare, dräng i samebyn under uppväxten, jojkare ifrån Tourpons sameby*	John- Mahtis Länta, renskötare Jåkkåkaska samebyAlla intervjupersonerna bor i Jokkmokkstrakten och jag kommer att följa dem i sitt arbete i de olika samebyarna.

What effects of that are the people carrying with them today? In 1928, the independence of Sami villages was abolished, when the new Grazing Act came into force. All Sami people who were not reindeer herders were expelled from the village; this law from 1928 that still stands in power has created major conflicts between Sami groups. How is it to actually be one of those who did not belong to a Sami village anymore? With this project, I want to convey the importance of the Sami land, meet reindeer herders and non-herders. I want to highlight the different values ​​that need to be preserved and thoughts about the future of a vibrant mix of facts, poetry and history. The interviewees are of different ages, which I have intentionally chosen in order to get a well-balanced report. The youngest interviewee is 20 years old and the oldest is 75 years. There will be more trips to Jokkmokk in the summer and autumn of 2016 with the aim to complement the photo sessions. The result will be shown in November when there will be an exhibition of photos and texts on the walls of Åsgatan 2 in Järna. There is also a lecture scheduled for the Stockholm area. The project is a mix of a documentation and art project.PROJEKTET -Urminnes markerDåtidens visdom som har passerat genom generationer och som tumlats om i statens hårda händer, vad bär folket med sig i dag ? År 1928 avskaffades lappbyarnas självständighet då den nya renbeteslagen trädde i kraft. Alla samer som inte var renskötare uteslöts ur lappbyn, denna lag från 1928 som än i dag står i kraft har skapat stora konflikter mellan samiska grupper. Hur är det att faktiskt vara en av dem som inte fick tillhöra en sameby längre?Genom projektet vill jag förmedla om markernas betydelse, möta renskötare och icke renskötare. Belysa olika värden som behöver bevaras och tankar om framtiden i en levande blandning av fakta, poesi och historia.Intervjupersonerna är i olika åldrar och det har jag med mening valt ut för att få en väl nyanserad rapport. Den yngsta intervjupersonen är i 20- års åldern, den äldsta är 75 år.Det blir fler resor till Jokkmokk under sommar och höst 2016 för att komplettera med fotosessioner. Resultatet kommer att visas i November då det blir en utställning med foto och text på Åsgatan 2 i Järna. Även ett föredrag planeras att hållas i Stockholmstrakten.Projektet faller mellan gränserna för dokumentation- och konstprojekt.",Costs of travells and of printing the canvas photos will be quite large so i hope I can find any fundraisers for this project.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2065651933/renskotarliv-reindeer-herder-life?ref=discovery_category_newest,2065651933/renskotarliv-reindeer-herder-life,"The sami people are the indigenous people of Sweden, Norway, Finland and northwest part of Russia.

With the exhibition the photographer wants to convey the feeling of reindeer herding, showing the beautiful and culturally significance of the reindeer herding tradition that belongs to the Sami people, the indigenous people of Sweden.The reindeer herding work is influenced and controlled by the reindeers needs and habits, this creates diffrences in the way of living for the reindeer herders in comparison with the majority population. The idea is to also highlight similarities with the majority population to increase understanding of the reindeer herders. Reindeer herders are in many ways like ""ordinary"" Swedes, dependent on the internet and new technologies. How synchronize the traditional reindeer keeper tradition where basic conditions are the same as 1000 years ago, with the modern society today?In March 2017, photographs will be exhibited at Àjtte Sami and mountain museum in Jokkmokk.

I centrum står familjen Kråik Jannok, Anneli och Lars-Ola och deras barn. Med fotografier och film visas och gestaltas renskötarlivet från dess innersta. Fotografen vill förmedla känslan för renskötseln, visa det vackra och kulturbärande som renskötseln för med sig, men också hoten i form av gruvor, rovdjur och järnvägen som alltmer tornar upp sig och förändrar renskötselns livsvillkor. Det här kan vara den sista generationen i Sverige som helt lever av renskötsel. Med ett massivt bildmaterial vill Leonarda Arcidiacono söka svar på frågan: Hur synkar man det traditionella renskötarlivet där grundförutsättningarna är desamma som för 1000 år sen, med det moderna samhället idag?

This also helps to study deep and independently. 20 real exam simulations are provided to sharpen your exam preparation.As the one who support us, you’ll get the largest exam prep catalog in the market. We count on you. Well prepared agile Project managers - give the exam the respect it deserves !We estimate a sales of more than 15000 copies in the next 3 years, 50 CHF each and distributed as eBook by Apple, Google, Amazon and Lulu as well as Online catalog by our webinar system.","As mentioned above, it exists already an online catalog of 1200 questions and 8 static exam simulations. To challenge the new 2016 certification there are 4 new books, but only 3 real new orientations of the certification. This is not really a risk. All aspects of this business is well known.A new challenge is the eBook that should support also exam simulations. Currently, only the online catalog supports exam simulations. We have developed a 1st Test-eBook that contains exam simulations and it sounds possible."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smoresnmore/smores-n-more?ref=discovery_category_newest,smoresnmore/smores-n-more,"Hi! We are the Green's, nice to meet you all! So, my husband Nick and I will be celebrating or 18th anniversary this year and our children are Dai, 16 and Kurt, 15. We are a young family and have experienced many, many challenges along our journey! We have always worked opposite shifts, so that we were the ones raising our children, and I have never had less than 2 jobs in  my entire adult life! I am a two time college graduate and have always had jobs that revolve around the health and well being of others and have not always had the chance to be home with my family to do the same.My husband has always had labor jobs for not even close to what he is worth, but our children have never gone without. We have always provided the basics and provided a nurturing, loving home, although not perfect, we have always done our best to give them a good life. We want to finally have the time to spend with them and give them the oppurtunity to be a part of starting and growing a successful business! In the process we want to travel the country with them and show them what America is made of! Combined my husband and I have over 20 years restaurant experience,and as a family we have come up with a unique idea for a new version of the food truck...a dessert truck.We bought an unfinished food truck and an old rv to travel the United States as a family and gave up all the creature comforts in life to put all extra income into the business.We have a brand new concept that we feel is going to take the US by storm and are SO EXCITED to make it happen!! This will be both of our childrens first ""real job"" and we want to instill a good work ethic in them.We have actually invested our entire nest egg into the business and are unable to borrow the money by traditional means, due to imperfect credit. So, we thought that we would give this a chance and see if anyone out there had whatever they could give to help us all live our American Dream!! Also, we would like to film the whole experience so that we can share  our adventure on youtube. We pledge that each and every penny that we raise here will be paid forward by us with our business once we get up and going, to try to help others with their dreams as well. Thank you for even considering helping us and have great day!! : )","There are many obstacles that we have overcome and that we know are in store! First, we have done this so far with no credit cards and a little cash weekly and our tax refunds for the last two years.With that very modest money we have managed to buy the 17×8 carnival trailer, a 6×12 product trailer to make sure we do not run out of product during events, a 275 gallon potable water container, incase there isnt a water supply at an event and various pieces of commercial equiptment. Also, we moved our entire family of 4 and 4 pets into a 30 ft.rv to save money on rent and have the ability to relocate for the business when necessary. Our daughter just turned 16 in Feb. and is graduating highschool in June 2016, as she plans to work on the food truck right out of highschool ( young business owner) and our son is doing online school to have full availability as well, so with all of that said, we have solved the burden of finding our first employees that we can trust to get the business started! We have all spent our entire lives over coming obstacles, we don't intend to stop doing so when we launch our family business!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smoresnmore/smores-n-more-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,smoresnmore/smores-n-more-2,"We are a young family of four Jessica (mom) and Nick(dad) Dai 16 and Kurtis 15. We have always been low income with tons of ups n downs but always carried eachother forward! My husband and I have always worked and have a combined total of more than 20 years in the restaurant biz, both front and back of the house! We have had this dream of owning our own food truck for a LONG time and need your help to make it happen!! We want to teach our kids that hard work, team work and treating employees well are a winning como for success!!❤","We have had challenges the whole way. We have used our tax refunds for the past 2 years to buy a very nice 17ft. food carnival trailer, 275 gallon water tank, much of the equiptment needed, but just do not have the resources to finish to launch! We need to wrap the trailer with our logo, buy sinks, a water pump, prep tables and a few other supplies. We also need product! I have already done the leg work negotiating with companies for ingredients and priced everything we need to launch successfully, now it is all about the money!"

I have traveled, and spent time, in many other states as well; each state has both a unique culture not found anywhere else, and a mainstream culture that reminds you that you are part of a much larger nation: USA.My idea is this: make a coffee table book that captures high-quality images of capitol buildings, and other significant cultural landmarks, in all 50 states. I will include a brief history of the state, the capitol building, and what makes that particular state unique.Through my pictures and writings, and contributions from generous patrons, I hope to accomplish these goals.Thank you all for your time an consideration.

Operations in Georgia, Alabama, & Louisiana. This non profit organization implements health initiative programs on collegiate campuses that directly impact their communities. Over 3,000 active members in 5 years.Top branches as of now are Tuskegee University, Troy University, & Dillard University in Louisiana. The first branch was established at Valdosta State University in 2015. Over 200 health related events in 5 years. Exercise sessions offered to campus and community on weekly basis.Our organization came across some major health disparities that the city of Tuskegee suffers from. Located in the center of a ""Food Desert"", meaning an area that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food within a proximity. Nothing but unhealthy fast-food chain restaurants to please their appetite. Everyday the people of Tuskegee, AL are put into a dilemma on deciding what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They either had to adhere to their appetite or health. This why Tuskegee is listed as one of the most obesity cities in America. No wonder Tuskegee is listed as one of the most obesity cities in America.Many of us forget about the history that lies behind the walls of Tuskegee. One of biggest things in Tuskegee is the university where the ""Tuskegee Airmen"" attended college and the home of the honorable George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington. They played a prominent role in American history and it would be a disservice to allow there community to suffer. Therefore, we engaged our Tuskegee University (AMFCA) branch within the community, reached out to the local farmers and revitalized the abandoned local farmers market for the community to have access to fresh fruits and vegetables at least twice a month, while at the same time provide a platform to where people of they can have fun and socialize.Unfortuanately, this doesn’t solve the city's food crisis completely. In order for us to make a larger sustainable impact we have to make this farmers market available more often as possible. Help cut out the commute to the next city Grocery store which is 30 miles away and being at the mercy of unhealthy fast-food restaurants. Also this was just one city of its kind in Macon-County Alabama. The (Black Belt Region) consist of 9 other communities that has to be reached as well. With simply restructuring, promoting, supplying equipment, providing options these cities can overcome this food desert. However, like always this takes funds to resolve years of abandonment, and with your kind donation the American Muscle Fitness Club Association is willing to do whatever it takes reverse this crisis.","There would be a challenge to get the community to make healthy food selections, however with food demonstrations at the market will see how food can be both delicious and nutritious.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/7pounds/farmer-to-consumer-access-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,7pounds/farmer-to-consumer-access-app,"As you all may have heard, major food distributers factories and enviroment have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. The employees have been testing positive for the coronavirus as well as the anmials; basically the food. Food chain retaurants and grocery stores are no longer buying from these major food distributers, as a result their restaurants are slowly running out of supply and have to eliminate items off their menus. However, many believe that these major food distributers are the only source of meat and fresh produce. My organization are in tact with many local farmers that have plenty of meat and fresh produce to go around. However, they don't have a way of letting the people know what they have in season and how to get it to them.This is where I took the time to develop an app to where there would be somewhat of a direct ""farmers to consumer"" transaction. As a technology major I then came up with an app that would act as a system to manage this operation. We call it the ""Access"" app in reference to the term ""accessibility"", which is understood as the availability of good health services within reasonable reach of those who need them and of opening hours, appointment systems and other aspects of service organization and delivery that allow people to obtain the services when they need them”. The people (customers) could either have the food delivered or can set up a curbside pick-up. There is sense of peace of mind knowing you have access to fresh produce and meat that hasn't been touched by many people or have been sitting in grocery stores for weeks.The app also contains features that include:Fitness: Weekly workout videos from our very own (AMFCA trainer).Recipe: View and share cooking recipes used with the produce bought from the local farmers.News: Updated news about the COVID-19 pandemic and how is it affecting your area.Nutritional Facts: Each fruit and vegetable has nutritional facts in its descrpition, explaining the health benefits of the item.Access Rewards: A rewards program that you can earn points off purchases to buy more items with those points.","The challenges is getting the people of a rural community to use advanced technology to order food, or just utilize the app. However, I plan to host virtual workshops for those who have trouble utilizing the app."

A new generation of players can be reached, playing real poolwithout age and environment restrictions, playing pool at the highest level. The visual appeal of the Pool On ""Ice"" table rivals any commuter games. A pro player contacted me from a billiard forum and wanted to know if one could really play pool on this new Pool On ""Ice table. I simply invited him to come to my place, bring his best game, and see for himself. I will just say that he stayed four days, could not win, tried his best to buy the table, and eventually left, but not before giving the table his unsolicited endorsement, writing ""This is the best table I have ever seen, bar none.""Others on the forum were knocking the table, sight unseen, and Larry just informed the folks that the Pool On ""Ice"" table was a lot of fun and they shouldn't rush to judgement. True Story!I envision large pool play areas with low cost overhead, such as semi- outdoor (screened covered patio environments) with as many as 100 tables per lot, a spectacular site from afar, getting better and better as the tables are approached. The physical exercise and skills development are the plus that will entice parents and children to the billiard scene.After 15 years of engineering and tweaking,  the Prototype isready for presentation. The Poolonice table is commercial qualityand owner friendly in terms of service. The bed cloth is both extremely durable and easily cleaned.  The 3 1/2 by 7 ft table (playing surface) is a joy to experience by players of all ages and skill levels. The table itself is virtuallyindestructible. The massive rails have K-66 rubber and Simonis cloth. Please visithttps://www.youtube.com/user/poolonice for all videos featuring the Pool On ""ICE"" table and developer Bob Barkhurst. Thanks!

Variations in materials, textures, environment, lighting, equipment, rules, humidity and players only adds appeal to the game.Enter the Pool On ""Ice"" pool table! (It's not ice, it just looks cool.)The table itself provides all the lighting necessary and is a people magnet in any setting. Players and non-players alike find the table irresistible. Skin tones are enhanced at a modest 120 watts. Logos, advertising and messaging are easily displayed using transparencies beneath the cloth.

The physics of the game is more pronounced.  Spin is easier to apply and control. Bank shots have greater ""back up"" potential. ""Throw"" of the object ball after contactis greater, making it easier to demonstrate the effect of cue ball spin on the shot.Deep cut shots become more playable. Peripheral vision of the entire table is enhanced.  Alignment of the cue is easier to see........ Folks with vision problems can enjoy playing pool again. Our goal is to make Pool On ""Ice"" tables available to everyone. ""Open source"" may be the answer. Information on building and servicing tables will be available. Many versions of the Pool On ""Ice"" table will follow. Nothing would please me more than having many manufacturers using ideas from the Pool On ""Ice"" table, especially now that our innovations have been thoroughly tested.A pro player contacted me from a billiard forum and wanted to know if one could really play pool on this new Pool On ""Ice table. I simply invited him to come to my place, bring his best game, and see for himself. I will just say that he stayed four days, could not win, tried his best to buy the table, and eventually left, but not before giving the table his unsolicited endorsement.Others on the forum were knocking the table, sight unseen, and Larry just informed the folks that the Pool On ""Ice"" table was a lot of fun and they shouldn't rush to judgement. True Story!I envision large pool play areas with low cost overhead, such as semi- outdoor (screened covered patio environments) with as many as 100 tables per lot, a spectacular site from afar, getting better and better as the tables are approached. The physical exercise and skills development are the plus that will entice parents and children to the billiard scene. This PROJECT started in 1997 after hearing announcers of televisedpool matches apologizing for the poor quality of the view dueto inadequate lighting. I reasoned that if lighting could be placedbeneath the table bed, shadows could be eliminated and the totalwattage reduced (120 watts), all while improving spectator viewing.After 15 years of engineering and tweaking,  the Prototype isready for presentation. The Poolonice table is commercial qualityand owner friendly in terms of service. The bed cloth is both extremely durable and easily cleaned.  The 3 1/2 by 7 ft table (playing surface) is a pleasure to experience by players of all ages and skill levels. The table itself is virtuallyindestructible. The massive rails have K-66 rubber and Simonis cloth. Please visithttps://www.youtube.com/user/poolonice for all videos featuring the Pool On ""ICE"" table and developer Bob Barkhurst. Thanks! ",Partner vendor relationships will be formed.Different materials and looks for the table cabinets are coming.

Oechsle, CEO    311 Alexander St    Rochester,NY 14604 Executive Summary    Tucker’s is a full-service restaurant located in the East End neighborhood of downtown Rochester. The restaurant will focus on Farm to Table practices and feature New American cuisine that fuses flavors from the melting pot of traditional American cooking techniques with global components.     My name is Kurt Oechsle and I am culinary graduate. My career as a Chef started here in Rochester and now includes being an Executive Chef, Culinary Instructor and lead culinary advisor at Spectrum Restaurant Consulting. I have been able to redesign and fine tune my conceptual idea of a dream restaurant through helping to open over 15 restaurants.     Tucker’s will lead the culinary way in utilizing fresh local ingredients. We will be a part of many community events and consistently donate our edible unused food to local food banks.     The increasing number of “foodies” and culinary explorers will revel in Tucker’s seasonal menu and modern techniques. The modern mid cetury design of the restaurant will feature a rotation of local artists and have the sounds of instruments from students at Eastman School of Music.Tucker’s aim is simple. It will provide a completely sophisticated, sensual, yet casual dining experience for the many Rochestarians and visitors who frequent the city's casual dining spots and entertainment venues. It will be an affordable venture for patrons, one that will encourage them to return on many occasions. The menu will feature hearty fare of the type that is frequently out of the reach of the typical young professional...out of reach because time frequently prevents her/him from cooking hearty meals like those featured on our menu. We are seeking $20,000. The funds will be used to purchase all kitchen equipment.Finally, Tucker’s success will come from providing a place for people to enjoy the incredible abundance of New York's finest produce, meat and dairy. For generations to come I will proudly display on a plaque in front of the restaurant...Thank You Rochester, my dream is now yours. Company SummaryMission StatementTucker’s is a Farm to Table casual restaurant that combines high quality ingredients with fun and knowledgeable staff. Objectives Have sales approaching one million dollars by the end of first year.Reach and maintain the highest reputation in Rochester through the press, awards and local voice.Successfully reach $80,000 in sales a month by June 2016. Keys to SuccessesProduct quality : Dynamic blend of local ingredients with masterful execution and a dedication to consistency.Service: Our staff will be knowledgeable of all the components that go into creating every item on the menus. All members will be attentive, gracious and fun. We will excel in consistency in preparation of dishes and being able to deliver them in a timely manner.We will reach out to Rochester’s sprawling suburbs where many of our customers will need to be reintroduced to downtown's new energy and exciting businesses. Tucker’s legal form of ownership will be an LLC. I have made many connections with local purveyors such as Headwater Farms, Kelly’s Apple Farm, JFS Food Distributors, Seven Bridges Farm, Chicken Thistle Farm and Pittsford Dairy. I have researched the East End’s demographics and talked with many people that live and work in that area. I worked at Hart’s Local Grocers and made many contacts with costumers and purveyors. I have seen the movement and trend towards certain food styles and eating habits.  Product/Service Description Tucker’s is a diner/restaurant/farm to fork establishment that sells moderately priced food to a casual dining market. The spot will serve locally made sodas, fruit juice and cider, neighborhood coffee from Rochester’s best roasters and some dessert selections will be brought in from some of the best bake shops. Our kitchen will create and work hard to stay above the trends while consistently preparing our diners favorites. We will create a relationship with our vendors and see both our passions grow together. Management will stay on top of training and research the competitive market.We will focus on creating all products on our menu directly at the restaurant. From our very own ketchup to our mile high pies and cakes.  Tucker’s breakfast menu will have both the hot griddle staples and numerous variety of egg creations. Lunch menu will include fresh ground burger from McCann’s Meat Market, towering sandwiches and amazing renditions of Americas favorite classics. The dinner menu will excite and deliver from “Begin Here” to “Big Plates” and straight through to “Don’t Miss” desserts. The Chef’s will create instant menu staples along with “you must try this at Tucker’s” specials.There will be live musical performances from students at the Eastman School of Music and other local talent during various times of the day.  Market Analysis Summary  The area is awake early for work and studying late for exams. Tucker’s will fill the need for a single restaurant that offers breakfast, lunch and dinner..Economics The immediate market area is within a 3 mile radius of the East End and includes neighborhoods of Park Ave, SouthWedge, Upper Monroe, Central City, Corn Hill, Brighton,19th Ward, U of R, Convention District and Upper Falls. The downtown resident population has grown by more than 2,900 people to over 6,100 since 2001. An estimated 1,800 or more will be moving in over the next few years. Through the proper use of social media, local news coverage and award winning press releases we feel that we can reach a national market and be a destination restaurant by our second year in business. The over-saturation of food establishments and the increasing demand from the public for restaurants to change their food philosophy could create a smaller share of our targeted market. I will be diligent with extending our local sources and obtaining only the best possible ingredients. We will partner with farmers to grow specialty produce and herbs exclusively for Tucker’s.   Although some trends in the restaurant world vary and go away we feel that Tucker’s will have the ability to adapt and modify to certain changes while still holding firm to our farm to fork concept.Product The food will stand out and be the focal point of the restaurant. The combined talent of over 100 years experience from our kitchen staff will work together and strive daily to execute the highest standard of culinary quality to our costumers.CustomersThe person that calls themselves a “foodie” will love Tucker’s because of our ability to satisfy the most discriminating palates. We will be proud to have both the novice and experienced culinary explorer sit and enjoy our artistic creation.I have been able to develop my repertoire most recently at Harts Local Grocers in their prepared foods department. The overwhelming response has been only high praise. I have made followers and people have asked to be the first table served at “my place”. The excitement surrounding Tucker’s launch and the countless number of “I will be a regular” or “I will eat there when you open” ensures our fantastic start.      CompetitionTucker’s closest competitors (relative to location) are Harts Local Grocers, Two Vine, Moes and Harvest Cafe.Harts is the only one that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with their prepared foods and the Cafe. Two Vine,and Moes only serve lunch and dinner. Two Vine is a upscale house with a large bar area and reservations are needed. Moes is a fast and previously prepared make it as you go restaurant serving the same menu all day. Harvest Cafe has a limited menu of sandwiches and salads in a  casual setting. Tucker’s menu will be seasonal and inspirational. The Chefs free creativity will enhance our ability to stay contemporary and exciting. We will give value to our selections with an atmosphere of modern farmhouse decor, local art work and fun attentive service. We will be the restaurant others will strive to copy. Strength-Built in Promotion: Participating in the Race for the Space and having a mutual advertising campaign with DHD will springboard our market awareness immediately.Location: Popular area for our targeted market.Weakness-Lack of Reputation: We haven’t established ourselves as a place to go.Opportunity-Food: Create a full on site bakery with a display case and orders for special occasions.Catering: Can increase overall revenue.Threat-Competition: Area attracts new business opportunity's for other restaurants.Food costs: Area bad crop season and disease can dramatically increase cost of goods.  Strategy & ImplementationPrice Our menu prices will average $10 for breakfast, $12 for lunch and $18 for dinner.  This based on a 28% food cost.  Our prices will be on par with Harts and lower than Two Vine. Moes will be comparable for lunch and Tucker's slightly higher for dinner. Harvest Cafe is right in line with both breakfast and lunch. Our pricing will be more all-inclusive where Harvest has additional pricing for many add-ons including NY State maple syrup.  We want our prices to reflect our dedication to outstanding creativity and high standard of ingredients. We will educate our costumers on the availability and pricing of certain foods during that season. Having the names of our sources on the menu reflects our respect for local products. Listing our vendors and displaying them in the restaurant and forming close relationships with them will show our commitment to seasonal local food.Place Our location is in the East End neighborhood of downtown Rochester at 311 Alexander St 14604. (We will have a business phone and email address as soon as we win.) Only a few steps from the Eastman Theatre and smack in the middle of Rochester’s second largest visitor attraction the Jazz Fest.Promotion Springing off the grand opening festivities from Race for the Space Tucker’s will set into motion a ad in the City Magazine running for the first month. Also, having contacts at 95.1 I will appear on the Brother Wease show the first week of opening. Our logo will be on our staff’s T-shirts, hats and aprons. All available for sale.Using ambient marketing with the use of holiday decorations and festive welcoming free warm mulled cider for guests and people walking the street in front of the restaurant.    We will use street marketing with a A frame sign in front of the restaurant.     Viral marketing with the creation of a website, Facebook site, twitter account and Snapshot. Asking people to post their best picture of a certain menu item online through Snapshot or Twitter. Then picking the best one and giving that person gift certificates. Posting our weekly menu online and offering a “what has been your favorite menu item so far?” section so we can keep track of our top sellers. We will use a grassroots style by asking people to submit a recipe for consideration on the menu. We want to be a part of the Public Market with volunteering my talents at their Chef table events. We will offer gift certificates for the holidays and offer a buy $25 and save $5, buy $50 and save $10, buy $100 or more and receive 20% off. We will have personalized coffee mugs for the regulars and offer discounts for multiple visits.  Management SummaryTucker’s is owned by a limited liability company including Kurt Oechsle, CEO.

With paws, head and ears all being detachable a child can use their imagination to create new and unique creatures and animals. We also have an accessory package that comes with bird wings and tail, pumpkin head, hats ans more. After being on ABC's The Toy we learned a lot. The mentor judges gave us many good pointers on how to make a safe and fun toy. The experience was priceless. We have since worked with a few toy manufacturers on designs and prototypes. I have also worked with some entrepreneurs I met on Facebook on how to properly move forward with our invention and business strategy. We have chosen a toy manufacturer and have had prototypes of our Connectimals made along with an accessory package for them (includes items we had on the Toy Box: Pumpkin head, bird wings, pirate hat, santa hat and more). We have created an LLC and got a Trademark and Copyright on our design. It has been a learning experience since we created these back in 2014 when my daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. We got our provision patent in 2015 and then posted our first Youtube video (this is how we were found by the talent agency which got us on ABC) and have been learning ever since. We now have a following since being on t.v. and have many followers on our webpage www.connectimals.com and our Connectimals Facebook page. I even have toy stores asking for our product. I believe we have everything in place as well as a safe toy to sell. If successful we have 5 new animals for series 2 of our Connectimals already in design along with more series. ","Most of our risks were brought up to us on ABC's The Toy Box.  The first one was choke hazards.  To solve this we made our Connectimals bigger.  We went from 7"" to 10"" tall animals so the ears and paws meet CSPC toy safety standards.  They are non-choke hazard size now.  The second hazard was the magnets.  High powered earth magnets under CSPC standards are banned in childs toys.  They are very dangerous if pulled out of the toy and swallowed. Our magnets meet their safety strength standards, yet are powerful enough to make our Connectimals work.  Any accessories (hats, etc..) are not connected by magnets but rather by velcro to the animals fur to make the toy safer also.  We want to make safe toy.  As a father myself I am taking all input I can to make sure this is a fun creative and fun toy.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/140401839/connectimals-lovable-plush-interchan-toys-with-acc?ref=discovery_category_newest,140401839/connectimals-lovable-plush-interchan-toys-with-acc,,Through research we made the magnets that we use in our Connectimals  placed in our product safely and securely.

Locals will be able to use either personal or shared plots, and learn about gardening through workshops. Weekly composting collection encourages the community to be involved on an ongoing basis and to collect compost in their homes and restaurants. Our first goal is to get the Jardin Urbano off the ground, which requires the initial infrastructure to be put in. This requires the following:1. WATER -- connection to the SAPASMA (city water) as well as a rainwater collection system. No blue, no green! A bicycle powered water pump gets water from storage tank (1100L) to the garden for daily use.2. FENCE -- the area is not currently totally fenced, which leaves our gardening supplies, water tanks, and the garden itself vulnerable.3. MEETING AREA & STORAGE WITH RAIN COLLECTION ROOF -- Rain flows during the rain season off the roof to be collected in the storage tanks. Provides shade, a meeting area, and storage as well.4. INITIAL PLOT PREP -- edging and soil for our initial plots5. COMPOST AREA -- Composting area starts our process of generating our own rich soil and involving the community in composting process.Once we reach our goal of $1000 USD, or 20,000 pesos funding this Phase 1 of the project, we will be able to kick off the Jardîn Urbano mid-2019, and invite you to join our gardening community!

And we need your support to go to the next level.Beyond Broth was an idea born 4 years ago out of a Mom's need when Grace got sick and craved her own soup but was not well enough to prepare it. She thought,""wouldn't it be amazing if I could have my own soup anytime?"" The idea was launched last year after 4 years of preparation, learning and support from mentors, friends, family and believers in this fabulous product that didn't exist until now.

NO ADDED SUGARS, CHEMICALS!Folks all over the country are loving these fabulous, yummy organic vegan broths that are sold in convenient single serve packets. You just add hot water, stir, wait 2 minutes and enjoy! The 3 varieties all contain the same veggies (sweet potato, carrot, beet, leek, parsley, celery seed, garlic, black pepper and a pinch of sea salt) which include Immune (with reishi mushroom, nettles, cumin and turmeric; Vitality with cayenne, lemon, rosemary & thyme; and Yummy Tummy with ginger, basil & extra parsley!Our standards of quality and purity are high, no dangerous chemicals in our products. They are a delicious, nourishing and and safe alternative  to the products that are on the shelves. Beyond Broth was born because of the lack of a simple, clean, organic,delicious option. Beyond Broth is not a meal replacement but rather something to be enjoyed instead of tea or coffee plus more nourishing. You can also add other ingredients like coconut oil, nutritional yeast, spirulina, dulse flakes, etc., to create a more nutrient dense broth or add your favorite veggies, protein, and grain to create a quick and easy, nourishing meal.To go to the next level and spread these packets of pure food, we need to hire a sales, marketing assistant and demo team ($10,000), plus pre-buy a couple of ingredients that are on shortage for our next run ($15,000). We have created a sales and marketing strategy which includes targeting over 350 Natural Food Coops and independent stores as well as outdoor recreation stores nationally. We have already begun acquiring new stores on the east coast.Please consider supporting our company that just produces products that are high quality, organic, simple, nourishing yummy food that is catalyzing our customers to take care of their health and wellness!Beyond Broth is on a mission of changing the way a corporate entity is run with integrity and transparency, plus we are on a mission to support humanity in feeling great with delicious, pure plant based, sustainable food that can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere!

Glad to have found it. It will be a great addition to my regular diet.Catherine on Aug 15, 2016Paleo LoveI am delighted with these flavorful & energizing soups - they are my new cupboard staples. In the morning mixed with bone broth or as an afternoon snack with a squeeze of lime, they are my go-to for something quick and satisfying. I love the portability (I keep them in my purse and desk drawer at work) and could see using a volume size, what with using them in recipes and as a light meal on their own. I lean toward paleo in food choices which often means a lot of time in the kitchen. These are a quick & easy alternative as Beyond Broth has included the ingredients that I would have chosen myself.","Over the past 4 years, we have taken Beyond Broth from an idea to a national brand...jumping through many hoops, overcoming obstacles and learning a tremendous amount about the manufacturing, production, sales, marketing, legal and financial aspects including the understanding of margins, distribution, etc. of the organic food industry. I have also come to learn the capital required. We are in the process of completing the next iteration of the business plan for the next round of funding. While completing the plan, we continue to get re-orders with existing stores, acquire new stores nationally with direct distribution, online sales, Amazon, marketing through social media, demos and events. The challenge is having enough money to hire staff to help us grow and keep up as it is getting too much for 1 person. The most effective form of marketing in brick and mortar is active demos...where someone must be there to educate, serve and sell the broths.  We also need the funds to purchase the ingredients that are in shortage (organic sweet potato and leek powders)  so we are ready for production as we grow to fulfill orders.If we can't keep up, we could lose valuable shelf space."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/952377180/the-unporkables?ref=discovery_category_newest,952377180/the-unporkables,"I wish upon wishes to make this project happen...This project down in the simplest of terms...The Unporkables is an MMO. You are a gangster pig. Mud is illegal. You create an empire of mud distribution.Furthermore:You bootleg mud to local Squeakeasies. Launder the money (Literally). Recruit other Gangster Pigs. Defend your territory from other gangster pigs. You also network and Create Syndicates with other Gangster Piggies (Other players) to take out the competition. Become the Kingpin of New Pork City.This is a game that is all about good clean fun. And I take that to heart. While you vie to take out opponents with use of force, you do so by means of cleaning them out! Quite literally. Water guns, cannons and soap grenades and the like are used in your driveby's and hideout raids. Destroying the competition with water power alone. So for it's edginess its still family friendly.The Background story of the game: Set in New Pork City in the 1930’s when mud becomes Illegal. The Notorious Pork Capone has tricked the Mayor into thinking that Mud is dangerous and should be Illegal. For fear of the Public safety, The mayor agrees to outlaw mud, However the dirty underhanded move was only a ploy by Pork Capone as he secretly capitalizes on this by creating an Empire of illegal Mud Distribution and hides it under the guise of The Pork Capone Cleaning Company which becomes the largest and most powerful Illegal Mud Empire in all of New Pork City.A bit more about me and this project. I’ve been developing The Unporkables for about fifteen years. I know you might think that I should be further along than this, however for as deeply committed and ever tirelessly working on putting this project in the right light and getting it out in the world, life has hopefully until now has had other plans for me. Largely working minimum wage jobs and fighting to keep fed and warm. yep.Where the funds go for this project. Right now this is obviously early in its developmental stage. The Idea is there, the gangster pigs are largely fleshed out but the rest of the concept, buildings and environment needs to be further realized. and I need time. Time for me is way more valuable than money. But money buys time to focus on the further development of this project.Once funded, I will also be able to set up a proper website for others to follow the progression. There is a current wordpress site for the unporkables, but need to have a dedicated site for this project.I hope that by deciding to help fund this project, you will want to see these lovable and hopefully ever endearing gangster piggies become a reality for all to play!Steve ""Steebs"" Schwertnermore images of the unporkables can be seen at:https://www.behance.net/Squeakeasy",nothing will stop these gangster piggies from seeing the light of day.

(And this is where I cut the record and yell spoiler alert!)In a foggy time and a pretty hazy place in an otherwise mysterious location, a crazy Hip Hop House party is going down, when a mysterious DJ spinning on the ones and two's drops the needle and scratches the record in a horrific way opening up a mysterious portal into a twisted dimension... (super ominous.. oh and you should totally be getting use to the over use of mysterious by now.) But this horrifying event in the twisted dimension is where horror and hip hop become intertwined. Enter our rapper, emcees and DJs that are on a mission to spread love and horror like its never been done before! This crew of Rhyme Slashers are known as: Pleatherface, Pen Head, Jam Master J-Son, Ill Kruges, and Mikey Cool J. ...And they're idle clicking and killin it all the way to the top of the charts! thats the story so far at least. Its subject to change a bit as to not paint myself into any corners and you know, other mysterious reasons.In this realm, You join these horror emcees as they hustle to build their fan base. Or their “fiends” But not blood thirsty fiends, more like hungry for fat beats kinda fiends... (Or fat beats and blood, that works too.) But you join these hip hop horror emcees in hustling their/your way to the top of the charts. Through growing and doing different hustles/side hustles that you complete, you grow your Fiend-base. I have a working list of these hustles/side hustles and a seperate list of touring locations that are mashups of iconic hip hop and horror places. Camp Crystaal - Fishing for bling is an example of one of the locations. (total of 8 locations currently.) Full disclosure, some of these things arn't fully worked out, but more about that later.Some of the game logistics are ""golden mixtapes"" are your gems, Dolla’s are dolla's... holla! (of course their will be ways to make it rain!... I mean, come on!) Coffins are your treasure chests. Sponsorship deals are currently a way you watch in app video’s. (evil necessity.) And as you climb the charts you collect gold records, platinum, double. etc. As for the hearse with hydraulics? Wouldn't I like to know.. It may be the touring van? Its also TBD. Whatever it is tho.... its gonna be dope! coz, come ooon! Its a low riding hearse with hydraulics!So that's the horrifying start to this twisted hip hop love story.More about that, ""more about that later"" stuff. why I'm here on kickstarter? Well this is the kick off. Development has up until now been only on my free time, But I really want to take development to the next level. Flush out the GDD and get a prototype kicking. I feel that the concept has legs to stand on, has mass appeal and I really need more time and resources to keep developing it.So, If you got love of the game, hip hop in your soul and horror makes you happy, this jams for you!(And thank you infinitely for any and all love and support. no mystery there.)","Challenges have really been financial resources lately. I've been stressed not being able to work on this thing like I'd really love to. And that's to say, full time attention. That and the right collaborators to get some implementation done. Let's get it in Unity and hustle it to the top of the app store charts! So ...Challenges? pffff! More like opportunities! ...word."

The image is projected onto a transparent screen that is almost invisible; after just a few seconds you don’t even see it - just like when you wear a pair of sunglasses.For racing, it will also be possible to fix the display to the inside of a visor with optical glue, simplifying the installation still further.Technical specs:•	0.35"" 9mm x 6mm transmissive display.•	IMX6 Processor running Android o/s.•	Low power 3.3V consumption•	Android 5 OS•	IEEE 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi connectivity up to 150MBps transmission.•	Target weight including battery: 100gOptics consist of a unique focusing lens/combiner/beam splitter that lets us make BIKEHUD ADVENTURE both small and lightweight while reducing cost. The display:•	Size is 1"" (25mm), since it fits inside the helmet•	Feels like looking at a transparent screen the size of a 25"" monitor about five feet away.As a comparison, BIKEHUD ADVENTURE speedo size appears to be around 9"" high at the equivalent distance to the bike’s dashboard.BIKEHUD ADVENTURE can be powered by its built-in battery OR via a cable. Typically battery life will be around four hours of continual uninterrupted riding via the built-in battery. It can be charged either when you take a break or on the move via USB through the on-board BIKEHUB controller OR via a phone-charge circuit if being used without BIKEHUB.BIKEHUD ADVENTURE can be configured through your smartphone or PC via Wi-Fi. Smartphone support will be Android and iOS at launch with others to follow.User-definable display - tailor it to suit your riding styleUser-definable display means you decide what you want to see on your BIKEHUD and when.For example:•	You might not want the tacho on permanently so you can turn it off and increase the size of other data to improve clarity•	You might want to display speed superimposed over the rear-looking camera•	Flip locations of gear position with speed•	Configure speed colour changesStorable configuration allows you to switch between your user-defined display settings throughout the day.For example:•	In the morning you might be in your daily commuter heavy town traffic that means you want to see what's around you with the rear camera permanently on and just a small speed notification.•	In the afternoon you might head out on a canyon scratch where you're more interested in getting the best out of the ride.You'll be able to switch between your stored configurations on demand.There are two modes: standard and racing.Racing modeThe BIKEHUD ADVENTURE is designed with an increased emphasis on competitive use. Whether short-track, motocross, endurance or The Dakar.We are working with racing's governing bodies such as The ACU and building on the original BIKEHUD CLASSIC to deliver a solution that not even the MOTO GP boys and girls have.Racing features include:•	Pre-race set-up and testing such as lap and sector times displayed in real time•	Ability to set braking and turn-in points MUCH more accurately than looking for markers on the side of the track•	The ability to upload and store this data to third party sites such as serious-racing.comBIKEHUD PITLANE – provides one-way communication via a smartphone from the pits/support teams to the racer. User-definable messages and icons to include such things as:•	STOP. Race abandoned due to accident/ hazard on track etc•	Return to pits either now or countdown in X laps•	You are X many seconds in front take it easy•	You are about to be overtaken speed up•	You are X seconds behind the leader go for itStandard modeOurStandard mode is the setup you need for everyday road use. New software developments that are supplied free with BIKEHUD Classic and introduced as standard with Adventure will include these incredible features:•	BIKEHUD Rule of three: much of the BIKEHUD’s development has centred on a crucial finding we made whilst consulting with occupational psychologists. The maximum safe number of outside data streams that can be processed in stress environments is 3 – 5. And so the ‘Rule of 3’ was born.This safety consideration is absolutely crucial to how BIKEHUD makes riding safer. Many gadgets marketed to bikers simply transfer the layout of information from bike dash to the helmet, even ADDING supplementary data that potentially distracts even MORE than a standard bike dash.BIKEHUD has three sets of default data: SPEED, REVS and GEAR. It then temporarily over-writes or combines data as necessary:•	BIKEHUD has been meticulously designed to relay all this information to the rider in a deliberately simplified format.•	Your cellphone GPS Navigation is fully supported providing a simplified junction layout and showing progress which means wrong-turns are a thing of the past.•	User configuration enables the user to set up various configuration options to suit not only the bike, riding style but traffic and riding conditions as they change throughout the days ride.The BIKEHUB controller collects and processes information from the bike such as engine revs, indicators and more together with its own built-in GPS information for speed.The BIKEHUB is at the heart of our system that communicates with all our existing components and permits all future hardware to be added via simple plug and play technology. It even has a charger for your smartphone. Main features are:•	Tried and tested. One simple box - not much bigger than an iPhone 4/5 will fit any bike. It really has been fitted to every type of motorcycle around the world covering the last 60 years of motorcycling history.•	IMX Processor running Windows CE•	Built in GPS module much more powerful that that built into standard smartphones. Can update speed changes up to 100 times/ second•	Expandable utilising the BIKEHUB expansion moduleWe've future-proofed as far as possible our systems too by ensuring that:•	Core software updates will ALWAYS be free.•	If you purchase a BIKEHUB, rest assured that new add-ons released by BIKESYSTEMS will ALWAYS plug into and work with the core BIKEHUB system you have on your bike.Cameras are used increasingly by bikers. There's a plethora of GoPro styled adventure cameras that can be mounted on the bike or rider at all sorts of different angles. We believe that we have gone one step further. Our flexible camera can be configured to:•	Switch off the telemetry and/or video recording. It is after-all a double-edged sword.•	Choose to have rear camera on permanently or on demand via BIKEHUD's four-button keypad.·A range of options - individual or combinedaffects the behaviour to include:·Press button to show, Button to cancel.·Press button once shows the rear for aconfigurable time.·Combinations of configurable gear/ speed/ indicators.·Acceleration/ deceleration rate turns on rearcamera for a configurable timeWhy mount cameras tothe bike and not the helmet?Our research has shown that cameras should be mounted to thebike rather than the rider’s helmet for a number of reasons:Outside features/specs of the cameras include:BIKESYSTEMS was incorporated in 2012 to commercialiseresearch by founder Dave Vout. Thetrigger for the idea came while riding a Suzuki GSXR 1000 K7 around 2010.He found that his leathers pushed up at the back of hisneck, pressing against his helmet and making it difficult to turn his head.Combined with his wide shoulders that blocked the sports bike’s mirrors, hestarted looking for something that could help him see behind more easily.Helmets were already available that used mirrors to providea view of the world behind, but besides wanting to keep his Shoei,he wasdisappointed that a pillion could block that view, and that when looking into acorner’s exit, he’d no longer see the road behind. He wanted a video camera anda Head-Up Display (HUD).After months ofresearch, he failed to find a solution with the versatility and performance heexpected, so he decided to make his own. By his own admission, Vout doesn’thave the skills to create the complicated lens system required for a HUD, orthe electronics knowledge to control it. An avid and experiencedrider for more than 35 years he spent two years previously conceiving and thenresearching the idea of a Head-Up Display for motorcycles. Optical, electronicsand software Engineers were commissioned to run a series of feasibility studiesas to the practical possibilities of whether such a concept was possible whileVout carried out research as to potential competitors, Practical, design, usage, safety and legalconsiderationsFrom these early studiesBIKESYSTEMS was formed. Its purpose was to develop a range of new products to addresswhat Vout believed to be a huge void in the motorcycle industry. That beingproviding a better interface between the rider, bike and passenger. He thought thisimportant through his own experience of riding fast bikes on modern UK roads.While he'd been riding for years, he was at best only putting around 2,000miles/year over the summer (typical of 85% of all bikes sold in the UK as helater found out). If the average rider was like him then experience meansnothing if the skill is not practised regularly throughout the year. He startedto ask other questions:·Riders areisolated - cocooned within their safety gear. Surely there was a better way ofproviding the rider with information without creating distractions ·Why were add-onssuch as intercoms etc so difficult to fit and why were the quality so hit andmiss?·Why wasn't bettercomfort such as overheating thought through and why oh why hadn't someone comeup with a visor demister or wiper system?From the get go therewere two principle design cornerstones for BIKESYSTEMS:·All BIKESYSTEMSproducts must fit to any motorcycle that had a 12v circuit. Regardless, of rider style, bike or locationBIKESYSTEMS products needed to be of benefit to all.·All BIKESYSTEMSproducts must fit to a currently available motorcycle helmet and clothing.Bikers often spend years finding the right helmet manufacturer, model and stylethat suits them. Helmet choice is NOT simply about style and fashion - it'sabout confidence and safety too. We've achieved thefirst. Experience has taught us that we'll cover 90% of the second. The first prototype ofour first product BIKEHUD ran in the fall of 2011.As with many prototypes,this bared no resemblance to the BIKEHUD that exists today. Those early dayswere vital not just to prove the concept worked but to understand what a Head-UpDisplay should display. It was at this time that the Rule of Three was conceived.We found that simply transferring a bike's instrumentation from the bike to thehelmet was not the profound Eureka moment we thought it would. A substantialamount of time was spent riding with the Prototype, refining the display,reducing its size, removing clutter while at the same time increasing the sizeof the information. BIKEHUD CLASSIC is the only motorcycle HUD currentlyon the market. While the company andinitial product range might be the brain child of one man, BIKEHUD is simplytoo complex to be designed and built by a single individual. As you mightexpect BIKEHUD's development is driven by a multi-disciplinary team of expertsthat are now headed by our newest and most important team members – ourcustomers. BIKEHUD CLASSIC It is the knowledge andskill-sets of all of our design professionals that has made BIKEHUD CLASSIC theresounding success it is. We measure our success as follows:1.Reliability: sinceApril we've had just three products fail in the field. This is a testament tothe solidity of the original design, robustness of materials used and QAprocedures.2.Returns: consideringthus far BIKEHUD has been sold via our web site our returns rate is less than2% which means we are delivering product that is what bikers want.Our achievements are nowbeing recognised by others. In September 2014 we applied for and were awarded a£60,000 ($100,000 US) EU grant for innovation. This funding will be fullyinvested in our ADVENTURE and BIKEVISION developments for 2015.Our agenda is clearlyset: to make motorcycling safer, easier and more fun regardless of use,experience, age, bike type, make, model. We anticipate our products willencourage more to try motorcycling as an alternative transport and excitingpastime.We have a strong partner mentality meaning that we developrelationships with long-term expectations. Our business partners know we arelooking for quality at a realistic price. We nurture a direct honesty whichmeans we get to the nub of an issue quickly saving time. Since everyone worksin an open environment and for the common good we don't need to apportion blame.The team simply works together to address issues in a timely fashion. All our suppliers are UK based meaning communication andmeetings take place in real time and are far more effective than dealing withmultiple time zones, complexity of language and communication issues. Ourmarket maybe large but it's not huge which means the economies of scale ofmanufacturing product in millions does not exist for us. Therefore UKmanufacturing is every bit as competitive as anywhere else in the world withoutthe need for long lead-in times and massive commitments to manufacturingvolumes. All of these factors ensure we operate in a real-time environmentenabling us to respond rapidly to the emerging needs of our customers. WearableTech is still in its infancy. We are one of the few companies worldwide that isproducing practical solutions in this field and currently the only onespecifically in the motorcycle industry reflecting the effectiveness of ourprocesses. We know each of our principles by name meeting with themregularly. Since we have a long-standing knowledge - we know our manufacturersand suppliers can accommodate our production schedules and deliver on time. Ourrelationship with our manufacturer is based on a contractual stock-purchase schemeallowing us to lever economies of scale, scale up our production WITHOUT thetraditional cash-flow implications.In short we are a new company with a traditional approach andvalues. Which means we can turn product around in an enviably short time.Our home is nestled right at the centre of the Industrial Revolution's heartland at the old Chatterley Whitfield Colliery in Stoke on Trent. Facts about where we are from includes:-•	Less than 0.5 miles North. Source of the River Trent. Fourth longest River in UK•	3 miles North East Rudyard Lake. Conceptual place of Rudyard Kipling. Famous Victorian writer and author.•	1 mile East. Home of James Brindley. Famous 18th Century Engineer and Engineer over Britain's first commercially successful canal.•	3 miles East. Birthplace of Reginald Mitchel. Designer of the Spitfire. Arguably the most famous aeroplane ever made.•	4 miles South. Birthplace and first factory of Josiah Wedgwood. Arguably the inventor of Mass Production and Modern Marketing . Member of The Lunar Society, Grand Father of Charles Darwin and principle abolitionist of slavery.•	And finally Chatterley Whitfield Colliery - The first colliery to gross one million tons/ year.As we are already selling BIKEHUD CLASSIC, we have reviews from real international users:CRISPIN MORRIS; Thailand–SEPTEMBER 21,2014:The installation wasvery straight forward as there is a very well written manual supplied with thedevice. I made a few calls and was very impressed with the customer service andsupport.I did take a few ridesto get all the settings to suit me but very soon I was convinced that the BikeHUD was essential for my situation.Riding is Thailand islike a game of space invaders until you get out of the city and then you havevehicles pulling out of U Turns slowly in the country side there is limitedsense of road safety. Thailand is a place where you must mad to look down atgauges etc. I just don’t look down any more.This device has made mea much safer rider and made me realise that it’s value is protecting lifetheres and there is no price on that!Having bought the BikeHUD I would be reluctant to ride without it. I hope to have the GPS integratedsoon.DAVID KERR: New Zealand–SEPTEMBER 5, 2014:I have had my HUD for alittle more than a month and am impressed. I have found the unit to besomething that is very quickly becoming my second best friend on the bike (wifebeing the first sorry Dave); it has proven to be easy to adapt to and becomesecond nature.ROB CRADDOCK: UK–JUNE 4, 2014:As an early adopter I’vehad it for a while now and after the initial setup phase I was good to go andnow wonder how I managed before it.As English weather canbe interesting I have used in variety of conditions and having all details infront of you, so not looking away from the road is very handy especially in thebad weather.ADIE KITACHI: UK–MAY 19, 2014:I’ve been using my BikeHUD for the past three months, every day in all weathers and of course at nighttoo. It has proven to be invaluable in rain storms when traditionally it hasbeen practically impossible to read my instruments and it has been fantastic inthe recent bright sunshine with absolutely no glare on the display. Operationhas been absolutely faultless and the fact I no longer need to take my eyes offthe road has greatly improved my riding experience. Buy a Bike HUD, you’llbe so glad you did!The BIKEHUD story has featured in many media titles including:Plus also appearing on UK's national TV network namely ITV 4's 'The Motorbike Show' hosted by Henry Cole.It also featured prominently at the UK's Gadget Show Live Future Tech Pavilion.In terms of current state of development of the new product, we're all set to proceed to the next level. With your help we'll be able to commence and complete:Currently we've competed feasibility studies and bench tests of the optics utilising off the shelf components. this has allowed us to create a mock-up and establish a comparison with the existing BIKEHUD CLASSIC.Our conceptual and feasibility studies are complete. Once we've completed our fund-raising portion of the project we'll commence final design of the hardware, software testing and manufacture. The following establishes why we'll be able to meet this schedule:•	The team and more importantly the team members have all worked on the BIKEHUD CLASSIC project and know it inside-out.•	ALL members of the Design and Manufacturing Teams are either working in the same office or within a 2 hour drive ensuring communication issues are kept to an absolute minimum•	We use standard components or tried/ tested procedures which means the design risks have been processed out.•	We are adding components to an otherwise completely tested and proven product.An  outline of the final project plan is below:","Most risks simply don't exist since we are only adding new functionality to an already existing and proven product that has literally been ridden all over the world for hundreds of thousands miles.Our team completed the final design of the original BIKEHUD in less than nine months From May 2013 to Jan 2014. That included:•	FULL final design of optics, mechanics, electronics and software.•	Trial installation on multiple motorcycles and helmets to ensure full functionality and out-of-the-box installation•	Independent testing of mount and electronics•	Full tooling•	Pre-Manufacture in batches of 3, 20 and 100 units to ensure product conformity, functionality and reliabilityTestament to the original design that there have been only two electronic changes and three field-based failures and returns in all that time. VERY impressive results from a small company.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1217074232/bikehud-adventure-augmented-vision-for-motorcycles?ref=discovery_category_newest,1217074232/bikehud-adventure-augmented-vision-for-motorcycles,"BIKEHUD ADVENTURE is our second generation Head Up Display system designed specifically for motorcycles. Our near eye display, focused at infinity minimises the time taken to view critical data in a centralised location with a single agenda – to maximise your attention on the road ahead.BIKEHUD seamlessly and wirelessly integrates with your existing equipment so well it is as if all of it was designed around BIKEHUD. From the latest GPS to noise-cancelling sound systems that enable riders to take that all-important phone call with a nod of the head while listening to crystal clear music. BIKEHUD gives you the ride you desire.A biker on a simple machine out on the open road, riding has a certain romance.Raw, adrenaline pumping excitement, life on the edge! The ride defines what being alive really means. For most of us, that is little more than a dream. Time, responsibility and capability mold our reality. We demand creature comforts, ever-greater technology. Sanitising our risk as we grudgingly conform to social restriction. Our highways are ever more congested. Dangerous too! Motorcyclists are up to 40% more likely to be involved in a KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured. Figures based on UK statistics) than in an automobile. Society's way of dealing with these safety issues is to impose ever-greater speed restrictions. In New Zealand and Australia, you will be booked for riding just 5kph over the speed limit. In Spain, it is as low as 3kph and in the UK there are discussions under way to prosecute speeding over 1mph. As the first product available anywhere, BIKEHUD integrates the technology that increases awareness, reminds us of responsible restraint while still promoting the sheer romance and lifestyle choices we as riders demand. With BIKEHUD you can extend your capabilities, conform to the law AND ride the dream!BIKEHUD - designed for YOUTwo versions to fit in with your equipment of choice, which means whatever your helmet, sound system and motorcycle there is a BIKEHUD that will integrate all of them seamlessly. A modular system approach that means functionality can be as simple or as comprehensive to suit your needs and your pocket.A context - oriented display inside your helmet means only relevant data is displayed when it is needed, maintaining your view on the road ahead. Making you safer. Making riding easier. Keeping things simple. BIKEHUD Adventure has four key components:-Near Eye Display – A tiny monitor that fits INSIDE your helmet, Just below your eye line. The display is colour-coded and simple. The agenda is simple – To keep you aware of things like speed & direction; Warn you of oncoming hazards; Inform you of who is calling you, potential traffic issues – WITHOUT you losing your focus on the road ahead.CPU & Battery case – The main electronics and battery are housed in a small weatherproof (IP64 rated) case that is mounted out of the way to the rear of the helmet. Naturally the system is wireless with a battery life of 6 - 8 hours continuous useRemote Key Pad – Most of BIKEHUD’s functionality is automated while you ride. But there are times when you need to input a simple command. Our context-sensitive four-button remote unit has foam and RAM-mount fixing options which means you can place it anywhere.Software –BIKEHUD ships with our standard App that includes gps navigation,integration with Bluetooth sound systems, speed awareness, fuel countdowns and telemetry logging for Android and IOS. There is anexpansive library of specialised apps for Track and Race, Off-road, Warning Systems, training technology, Safety/ speed cameras under development.The modular approach of BIKEHUD means that you can have a system as comprehensive or as simple as you need. Accessories to expand your BIKEHUD and are coming in 2016 include:- Bike Mounted module to read engine revs, gears, indicators etc; Purpose designed helmet-mounted Front and Rear Camera.Our original BIKEHUD was ahead of its time.

These are the pledge levels that are up for grabs – act fast to get one. These offers won’t be repeated!As well as what you see here we’ll throw in a few extras:As a concept BIKEHUD was formed in 2010. As ‘mature’ riders we were aware of the time taken to focus/refocus between the road ahead and instrumentation. Each time we checked we were riding blind. Our concept was to centralise all relevant information from the bike and surroundings and present it to the rider maintaining the view on the ride ahead without having to re-focus, without distraction. Legalities and safety were paramount. We spent over a year researching theories, research, legalities and safety implications. We also commissioned a series of feasibility studies for technical requirements. 2012 saw the first prototypes. These test beds were used to research ideal positioning, size, display format & content.More than 12 months elapsed before we arrived at our Rule of Three concept which ensures BIKEHUD provides the right information to the rider at the right time without causing distractions. In May 2013, final design of generation one commenced. Two core design considerations ensure that ALL BIKEHUD’s fit to motorcycles and currently available helmets regardless of age, style or manufacturer. The original BIKEHUD was launched at the UK’s Bike Show November 2013 and started shipping early January 2014. Something of a record in manufacturing terms.With our first BIKEHUD we have gained an incredible amount of data while establishing ourselves as a good reliable supplier. Our second generation BIKEHUD – ADVENTURE is set to turn our ideas into the mainstream for the benefit of all making riding safer, easier and so much more fun.","BIKEHUD ADVENTURE is our second generation wearable technology. We were able to bring our first version to market in a very short time. Six months in fact from design to selling including all the tooling and first batch manufacturing. Naturally we've learned a lot from our first product. Perhaps the biggest lesson we've learned is not to try and do everything in one go. Focus on the basics and get that right first.What that means for the new BIKEHUD is that we've spent our time by getting the electronics and positioning correct first. As we move to the tooling and testing phases, we're making enough pre-production versions not only for our own testing purposes but also for our Distribution & OEM Partners and also to allow Journalists that all-important first peek.Working in this way we are a good four months off the final manufacturing stage which means risks of delays due to hardware-related issues are kept to a minimum. Our testing team are based around the world - New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, Canada and of course right here in the UK. We've got a range of age-groups and a mix of both ladies and guys. Some of the test team are also users of our first generation BIKEHUD.When BIKEHUD hits the streets it will be running with both Android and iOS Apps. As part of our agenda to keep things simple the initial Apps will be somewhat basic - covering BIKEHUD's integration via Bluetooth for smart phones and wireless headsets. It will sport a simple GPS app together with  the ability to display speed plus a few other features such as range markers. Over the course of 2016 our software portfolio will grow from this stable base. We even have independent development partners on-board too - providing Apps for competition, training and advanced warnings. Some of these are sponsored by US Fed' and EU governments. All this means that your BIKEHUD grows in capability.Initially that first batch will be a small volume..... Just to ensure our manufacturing is correct and there are no last minute gremlins. Limited runs initially gives us time to ensure every BIKEHUD made gets the Rolls Royce treatment for quality and inspection. We reckon that is two reasons why you should sign up early for one of the first batches.We would be foolish to say we have eliminated all the risks however we believe our track-record demonstrates we have a handle on all the most obvious ones."

There is still a long road ahead and many more obstacles to come, but I am confident that this project will find its way into many film festivals in the near future. One of the biggest obstacles during this project has been funding. Every aspect of filming, from writing the script, auditions, location scouting, equipment and props rental, feeding the cast and crew, lighting, permits, scene setting and construction to post production, distribution, and marketing requires a great deal of financial support. I have learned to cut costs whenever possible by cooking for my cast and crew instead of catering, being involved in community work to be able to barter for shooting locations, buying second hand equipment.I am very determined to finish this project, no matter how many obstacles I face or how long it takes.

WHY KICKSTARTER?Kickstarter is a perfect one-two punch for a passion project or startup. It generates awareness and interest in the project and is a vital tool for creators like us in bringing our projects to life.A film like this would usually cost 5-6 timeshare than the amount we are raising. We are navigating this obstacle by working with passionate and professional colleagues who are generously willing to donate their time and skills to tell this story. We are also using other creative solutions, such as researching shooting locations where we will have free or discounted access and using available equipment that won't compromise the overall quality of the film. We are working to find any and every one of these solutions to make the project feasible to shoot for a low budget. However, there are always costs involved in filmmaking, and the level of style and design we have planned for Hellion make even more of those costs unavoidable. These costs are for things like:EQUIPMENT: We will need to rent any equipment that we are not able to have donated for our shoot we will need to rent.LOCATION: A portion of our funds will go to the rental of locations, permits, props and other visual pieces we'll be showing you in the film.SPECIAL EFFECT ARTIST: Likewise, we'll need to go beyond just our actors' closets to ensure their characters look and feel as true in the film as possible.FOOD: Keeping a cast/crew well fed is a must for them to be able to produce their best work.TRANSPORTATION: As we're shooting in multiple locations, we'll need to transport our equipment, props, set decor and more from one place to the next. To do this we'll need more than personal vehicles can offer.FOOTAGE: We'll need to purchase hard drives to store all of the footage we shoot and for editing and post-production purposes.MUSIC/SCORING: In a stylized film like this, the score can make or break the film. By allocating some of the budget to the hiring of musicians and small recording costs, we elevate the overall quality of the film.FESTIVALS: There are costs associated with screening a film at any festival and we plan to enter and screen Hellion at many.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dionies/dionies-sports-apparel?ref=discovery_category_newest,dionies/dionies-sports-apparel,"Pronounced [dahy-oh-nees], Dionies is a name that was thought of in 1985 by a then ten year old Xavier Grimes who had a vision to design a tennis shoe. With no clear meaning to the name, he defined it as “Great Success”.  Growing up as a child, he began to sketch his first ever Dionies shoe.The shoe design became a living being that consumed him to learn more about the process of shoe design and manufacturing. As a child, drawing wasn’t difficult, but the idea of designing a tennis shoe was far beyond a pencil, crayons, and a piece of paper, it required understanding design techniques that he wasn't focused on.It was clearly to draw a better shoe.After drawing his first sketch, he began to perfect that one shoe design until it became what he envisioned to be the next best sporting shoe.Dionies, another superb sports shoe supported by its constructive design for stability. Dionies are equipped with a unique sock liner, The Pazer system, which provides extra arch support alone with better comfort. Equipped with its double padding, the Pazer sock liner is light weight and gives the best support to every foot. Supported by the PDXC system, the Padded Dimension for Extra Comfort, the PDXC allows the forefoot and heel better relief in movement. The forefoot unit provides extra cushioning during continuous shoe wear, allowing tension to subside from the foot. The heel unit gives better comfort to the heel alleviating pressure applied during excessive activities. Together the Pazer and PDXC systems work at giving way to force applied to the side of foot, forefoot, and heel, making it comfortable to wear Dionies.Introduced in the early 90’s, with a small quantity of t-shirts, sweatshirts and baseball caps, Xavier set out to position Dionies in the sportswear market by gaining exposure in the Atlanta entertainment industry.The overall goal was simple, to provide the world with “A New Look, A New Attitude” in sports apparel by offering a new brand. With major brands such as Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Fila, to name a few, we knew the competition would be difficult, but our goal was simple, to provide the world with “A New Look, A New Attitude” in sports apparel.With the objective in mind to advertise and sale Dionies via mail ordercatalog, Xavier created aDionies brochure with mail order form, and bulk mailed them to potential customers in rural areas that he knew his competition didn't reach. Keep in mind, we are talking about a time where Internet didn’t exist, and the closes shopping mall for rural America was a city within 20 miles or the next state over. And the next best thing to ordering sports apparel was the Eastbay catalog.Taken the Eastbay approach, Xavier set out to sale the small inventory of Dionies apparel, in hopes of capturing a market that was already dominated by big brands. However taken the direct mail route.As time passed, Dionies became just a thought on the shelf collecting dust. However the dream and goal continues to burn. That goal is to bring a new sports line to the market.It's been over twenty years, and today, Dionies is looking for another breath of life, and is asking for your help to re-introduce the brand. This time, we want to introduce the entire line. If you can see the vision, help make it a reality, your support will not be in vane.Thank you for your support,Mr. Xavier Grimes","The success of Dionies depends on its marketing and the audience acceptance. Although the competition is really stiff, we know Dionies has an opportunity to enter a market that is overly saturated and do very well. Our most challenging moment will be the initial launch, however we know that with good marketing it will go off well. Our plan to combat the audience acceptance is to push the product extensively in a grass roots campaign.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dionies/the-web-nterprise-presents-spaceship-muzic?ref=discovery_category_newest,dionies/the-web-nterprise-presents-spaceship-muzic,"The W.E.B Nterprise (We Eat Beats) Presents Spaceship Muzic is a musical hip hop project featuring rap artists Royale and Choppa Maine. The project consists of music that defies the norm in hip hop. The overall objective of Spaceship Muzic is to connect the dots between the black and white generation gap in music and connect them to reach the grey area. The project features Royale and Choppa Maine, who delivers the most powerful lyrics unlike what is currently heard on the radio, over some great production. Together, the lyrics and production makes the project out of this world.Spaceship Muzic as I've been told by Royale and Choppa Maine is music that everyone can relate too, which has no boundaries. It is unlimited and has a broad range beyond the norm of music. It is music that every generation will enjoy.In the summer of 2015, I was introduced to two guys from Miami, who like many in America came to Atlanta to follow and pursue their dream of getting into the music industry. The plan was simple, to come to Atlanta and meet for a week and take care of business. However, a week became several months, as we vested time and energy into building the The W.E.B Nterprise brand. As days went by, we created this logo which Royale (the visonary of The W.E.B) saw, and together we created something simple via Corel Draw that defined the brand and his vision.Each day I watched these guys perfect their craft as I would be introduced to new material. Day after day, night after night, I would hear music that pushed me harder to get back into the industry I so loved for over twenty years.Royale and Choppa Maine, would sit, talk about, and listen to their creation over and over again only to make it better. This type of behavior showed me their dedication to make quality music, which kept me interested in helping them pursue their dreams.With original songs like ""Where I'm From"", ""I Got Some Feelings for You"", ""Asian Persuasion"", ""Looking for Some Trouble"", too the introduction of Spaceship Muzic, these songs proved to me that Royale and Choppa Maine had something the music industry is really missing. The music by far is the best I've heard in a long time on a commercial level. Being in the music business for years, I've heard good music, as I've heard bad, and I can truly say that Royale and Choppa Maine brings good lyrics to Spaceship Muzic.The struggle is very real, like many artists pursuing their dreams, they left everything behind in Miami, to make this dream a reality. Today, they eat, sleep and breath it. Today, Royale and Choppa Maine continues to record new material with little funding, equipment and space to see to it that Spaceship Muzic is completed and shared with the world. The two are constantly meeting new aspiring talent that they can work with you to help fulfill their dream, and are constantly introducing these artist to The W.E.B Nterprise.This is just a small dose of what we have done to bring The W.E.B Nterprise Presents Spaceship Muzic to life. Over the course of two months we created the logo which defines the brand of the Nterprise, and created five songs to place on the project.We have more work to do, and would need you in getting us there. Production cost to purchase the beats needed as well asmarketing and distribution. Would you help us bring real quality hip hop music back to the industry so we can reach the grey area. The grey area is the target market we define as the lost generation in music. Somewhere between Generation X and Generation Z, music seem to have lost its touch. Spaceship Muzic will be the music that will connect with them, trust me.","Like any music project there are many risk involved. The risk of the material being accepted by the music industry and the audience is risky. The main delay that has kept Spaceship Muzic from being one hundred percent complete is the purchase of music that has already been recorded to by other artists as well.The major risk being that majority of the songs already complete are done to music that has been produced as royalty free beats that anyone can use. However, the use of the material for capital gain without the proper permission and use from the producer permits copyright infringement.Therefore, money is needed to pay for the exclusive rights to use the beats to proceed with recording in the studio."

Our iShareMem app (available on iOS and Android) allows people to share their precious moments with their loved ones instantly and privately no matter where you are in the world.With a mission of reducing the complexity and costs for the digital menu boards, we created our first Dynamic Digital Menu (DDM) product that allows people to easily create and display content of their digital/electronic menu boards on big displays through web browser and Google Chromecast. Instead of paying thousands of dollars to implement a traditional digital board, you can spend less than $100 with no technical knowledge to maintain/modify its contents within minutes.We never stop innovating our products to make them easier, faster and cheaper for our customers. This is the reason why we have started this “Digital Menu Boards on Amazon Fire Stick” project.With this project, our DDM product will be easier and faster for people to use. Our DDM product will be pre-loaded on Amazon fire stick. People just need to do the following 3 simple steps to have the digital contents displayed on the big screens:1. Plug Amazon fire stick into an HDMI slot2. Login to iShareMem account3. Select an event - All photos of that specific event will be displayed in a slideshow modeImagine that when you are at a birthday party, or at a graduation party, all of the photos that are taken by you and others are displayed instantly on the big screens effortless. Imagine that now the restaurant owners can afford to have their restaurant menus displayed on big screens for the customers to see instead of the customers have to ask for the menus every time. Imagine that all the supermarkets now have an affordable and easy solution to have their on-sale items displayed on big screens around their stores. The usage of this product is endless.For more details about DDM product, please visit https://youtu.be/BLV97XnEoggWe just started the porting effort and it will take about 8-10 weeks to finish the project. We anticipate that we will have the final product available in the market between 6/15/19 and 6/30/19.We are committed to complete this project, as we are very passionate about enhancing our daily life through technology.The requested funding that we are raising will be used to pay for the porting effort.For more information about our company and products, please visit us at https://isharemem.com",The effort of this project is mainly to port the DDM functionality (viewer function of our iShareMem app) to Amazon fire stick.  The backend would remain the same that is implemented on top of Amazon Web Services.  There is very low risk to this project as the DDM functionality is already implemented and working nicely on our mobile app.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1661767632/the-escort-an-independent-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,1661767632/the-escort-an-independent-feature-film,"‘The Escort’ is a drama with a simple concept – a young man has 60 minutes to convince an escort to leave her line of work – but despite the premise of featuring only one location and two characters the story evolves into something more, examining the state of relationships today in a digitally-obsessed world where sex is easily available at our fingertips and the idea of love has been greatly distorted.Written over the course of 6 months after interviewing both current and former escorts, the film provides both an indictment of the exploitation of women in this industry while examining the wider socio-political structure of our society which has led to a segment of women feeling they have been put in a position where they have no choice but to enter this line of work. It asks the question of whether true love can be found in a profession that sells a false version of it while opening our eyes to the destruction caused for those who sell their body and those who purchase the use of one.Yet at its core ‘The Escort’ is a film about two deeply flawed individuals – a woman who is no damsel in distress and a young man who is no saint – drowning in pain who over the course of their journey come to realize that they may have found their saviour in each other. It is ‘Chasing Amy’ for a new generation, a film featuring two refreshingly friendly, relatable characters who engage in a frank and honest discussion about sex in a verbal battle akin to a tennis match as both try to fight for their beliefs and peel away the layers revealing who they really are.Every generation has a film that reflects the state of relationships for themselves and for me that movie was ‘Chasing Amy’, and while we have had films both before and since from ‘Sex, Lies and Videotape’ to ‘Closer’ and ‘Shame’ no film has spoken to me more than Kevin Smith’s deeply personal story. ‘The Escort’ intends to do just that for a new generation of moviegoers as we examine the impact the social media age has played on society, relationships, and sex with a story that while fictional has become deeply personal as a result of the interviews held with real escorts whose stories I intend to tell.The GoalWith a passion to make this film I have spent the past few months scraping together a small budget to accomplish this goal, with offers from others to serve as a crew for 2 weeks in order to have this movie made, further individuals to act as editors for free, and veteran filmmakers consulting on the film. Yet despite being a dialogue-driven film ‘The Escort’ intends to be a visceral experience providing the audience an opportunity to step into the minds of these characters as the tale plays out in real time, with both the production design and technical equipment including our lighting and choice of camera required to support this vision.While efforts have been made to mitigate cost which include setting it in one location with 2 characters and creating a short filming schedule it remains vital not to sacrifice certain areas, and for this reason in order to make an independent film that retains the integrity of both my voice as a filmmaker and the voices of all those I spoke with when exploring this subject, I am in need of your support to help finish this project and bring ‘The Escort’ to our screens.‘The Escort’ is being shot on-location using professional actors for which I am covering these costs in addition to props, rehearsal space, visual effects (which are minimal), and food/travel expenses for the cast and crew. While there is a small budget left to contribute towards the purchase of adequate sound equipment and the camera rental further funds are necessary to hire and purchase the adequate camera, sound and lighting equipment, in addition to having a proper sound mix, editing suite, and ADR, and ensuring costs for rewards shipping are met. I am able to get some of these at a discounted rate and noting costs include £6k for lighting, £3.5k for camera and relevant associated equipment, £400 for the grip, and additional expenses for the aforementioned features relating to sound, editing, and shipping rewards the bare minimum  I require to make this film would be £15,000 which I have set as the Kickstarter goal.While this amount would be sufficient to create the film any extra funding would help enhance it and achieve additional goals, including the use of certain songs which I hoped to meld as part of the film (‘El Unicornio Azul’ as sung by Cecilia Nöel,  ‘Earthtime Tapestry’ by Spacecraft, Artie Shaw’s ‘Nightmare’, and ‘Kiss You Goodbye’ from The Loft all became part of the story as I wrote the script), hire a composer, colour correction, and the chance to raise awareness by reaching a wider audience through festival submissions. For this reason the ultimate goal has been set at £27,000. Any amount raised will go directly into the completion of ‘The Escort’ and I am appreciative of any support you can give.With your help I believe ‘The Escort’ will be a film that not only acts as a pleasant date movie like ‘Chasing Amy’ and ‘Before Sunrise’ with food for thought but also serves to stimulate the conversation about relationships today, and lead to a wider discussion around issues which have yet to be tackled, such as the exploitation of workers and the misappropriation of talent which prevent them from achieving their dreams despite their skillsets. And ultimately to shed light on the escort industry in its current state.If for any reason you can’t pledge funds towards this film but would like to support please share this project and spread the word to friends, family, neighbours, strangers, social media, and anyone who comes to mind for if even 1 person pledges as a result of your actions that is one step closer towards the completion of this film, and as Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing approach each and every person who supports this project will be the deciding factor in the completion of this film.Please visit our websitewww.escortfilm.com and join our mailing list to receive updates and be a part of this journey.Good Deeds mean Great RewardsYour support means the world to me and my gratitude must be responded in kind. Noting that ‘The Escort’ is ultimately about human connection the rewards on offer are a continuation of this theme, with props among the rewards on offer although due to the subject matter of this film we have to be selective with what is picked!Who We AreBizhan Tong started writing screenplays at the age of 12 and at 14 launched a DVD website in order to indulge in his passion for movies while using his earnings to make short films. Going on to earn a BSc (Hons) in Maths at the University of Manchester Bizhan continued to write and create films at every opportunity, and during this period produced the award-winning feature ‘Fix’ starring Olivia Wilde (Tron Legacy, House) and directed the short ‘Ticket’ starring Rory Girvan (Sky TV’s ‘Stella’). At 21 he studied for an MBA and graduated with Distinction by which time he had gone to work in finance. Yet his experiences only served to strengthen his passion for film as a means of expression, and in addition to taking filmmaking courses taught by Elliot Grove at Raindance and write further screenplays to hone his craft Bizhan volunteered to film various corporate videos to see how far he could stretch the boundless limitations of art within a corporate culture, which included a stop-motion animation and an homage to ‘24’. Inspired with the idea of writing ‘The Escort’ after talking with one while waiting for a meeting one day Bizhan’s passion for this project grew, and he spent 2015 preparing to make this film having decided that after many years of writing and directing shorts he was now ready to create his first feature.Andrew Bajulaiyegraduated from Brunel University with a BSc in Multimedia Design & Technology. He is a motion graphics designer and offline editor with vast experience, having worked in the video games industry and on various commercial campaigns which include Nissan, Sonic the Hedgehog, The Crew, Metro, and Defiance.","There are inarguably many challenges in the making of any film, with the biggest obstacles based on overcoming budget constraints without sacrificing quality and our position of directing our first feature – while ‘The Escort’ was originally conceived as a short it was upon interviewing escorts and writing the script that we realized it was destined to be a feature, and that we would be working tirelessly to achieve this goal but it is a path we are passionate to take. In regards to budget limitations having had many years of experience managing budgets due to my background in finance and past history running a business and making shorts I have addressed these concerns to ensure the film is made within the imposed financial limitations so that the movie may be completed and be a reflection of our original vision without requiring any further funds beyond what has been set. Remaining on schedule is also imperative and while I have tried to consider every possible factor which can cause delays room must always exist for the unanticipated, thus in order to be in a position where I may fulfil my promise and provide the digital downloads on time I have set a delivery date of March 2017 in order to ensure the digital downloads are sent by then. I will also provide regular updates via our website and Twitter so that you may follow us on this journey as the film is created and released within this timeframe.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1661767632/mute-45-min-film-based-on-a-short-story-by-stephen?ref=discovery_category_newest,1661767632/mute-45-min-film-based-on-a-short-story-by-stephen,"As a fan of Stephen King ever since reading ‘Rose Madder’ at the age of 11 – which remains one of my favourite stories to this day – it has been a dream of mine to adapt one of his tales and pay tribute to the man who inspired me as a writer, and who is responsible for some of the greatest movies in any genre, from ‘Carrie’ and ‘The Shining’ to ‘The Shawshank Redemption’ and ‘Stand By Me’.  After making a feature film, ‘The Escort’, earlier this year which itself featured only one location and two characters I set about adapting ‘Mute’, and try to find the right visceral tone to reflect the mindset of the protagonist in innovative ways in order to do justice to the characters so vividly crafted by King. The result is his 11-page short story has been adapted into a 45-minute adrenaline rush with an aim to haunt audiences long after the credits have rolled.While King’s stories work remarkably well due to the author’s respect for the reader and his ability to take us to the outer recesses of the imagination some film adaptations have faltered through their attempts to dilute some of that power and alter the story so much the final tale is a husk of its former self. My adaptation of ‘Mute’ refuses to fall into this trap, instead faithfully adapting the story he wrote for the visual medium of film while expanding upon the themes which were examined within those pages, and while his story acts as a springboard to delve further into those themes this adaptation will take us beyond the conclusion of those 11 pages in an attempt to address what happens next, leading to a chilling third act which brings those themes and strandlines together, and which I hope will make its author proud.The GoalThis story is a film I have wanted to make for the past 2 years due to my immense passion for King’s writing, and childhood desire to one day adapt his work for the screen. As a result I acquired the non-exclusive licensing rights to ‘Mute’ through King’s Dollar Baby Scheme, and this film is being made on a non-commercial basis; i.e. every penny and dime contributed will go directly into the making of this film in order that this remarkable story may be told onscreen.Having already adapted the story into a screenplay I have spent the past several months crafting a plan to shoot the film on a modest budget while ensuring the quality of storytelling is not impacted as a result.With most of the film’s small list of characters already cast (outstanding are the wife's lover Cowboy Bob and an unconventional Priest who hears the confession which bookmarks this film), I am now seeking to raise funds in order to begin pre-production on the movie with a view of shooting in February with the film completed by July. In terms of equipment while I will be calling in favours from various friends to help lower the cost from the use of lighting to GoPro cameras (for certain aspects of the car scenes) my intent is for this to be a professional film made for the silver screen and therefore we will primarily shoot using the Canon C500 thus rental costs are part of that budget, as are expenses for various elements such as travel, food for the cast and crew, props, sound, make-up, the car itself, and potentially location (while the vast majority of the film takes place in a car there are scenes in a church and the protagonist’s residence, though I have had conversations with relevant parties to see if they can be offered to us for free). In addition the fundraising goal has been set taking into account the cost for rewards shipping are met with a third budgeted towards post-production (editing, sound design, color correction, grading).With your support my aim is for ‘Mute’ to not only join the list of great literary adaptations for the screen, but to be ranked as a road-trip thriller worthy of Top 10 lists, so that it may be uttered in the same breath as ‘Collateral’, ‘Vanishing Point’, and ‘Duel’. More importantly my goal is for ‘Mute’ to be a faithful adaptation of King’s work, and effectively tackle the aforementioned themes of intimacy, identity, and inefficacy which struck me when reading this story and which I believe can be explored further in the canvas of film.If for any reason you cannot pledge funds towards this film but would like to support please share this project and spread the word to friends, family, neighbors, strangers, social media, and anyone who comes to mind for if even 1 person pledges as a result of your actions that is one step closer towards us making this film, so each and every person who supports this project will be the deciding factor in the completion of this film.A Prize for the WiseThis film rests on your support and every person who pledges will receive my immense gratitude. But as the story hinges on the relationship between two characters – one who speaks and one who does not – words are not enough to express my thanks and for this reason the rewards provided go beyond a ‘Thank You’ gesture (though this will also be provided) in order to more prominently express my thanks and show that as a non-commercial piece every one of us are together on this endeavor.Who We AreThe team includes (but is not limited to):Bizhan Tong (Writer/Director) has been writing screenplays for the past 18 years having started at the age of 12 and at 14 launched a DVD website in order to indulge in his passion for movies and make short films. Going on to study at the University of Manchester Bizhan continued to write and create films at every opportunity, producing the award-winning feature ‘Fix’ starring Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy, House) and directed the short ‘Ticket’ starring Rory Girvan (Sky TV’s ‘Stella’). In addition to taking filmmaking courses at Raindance Bizhan filmed various corporate videos to see how far he could stretch the boundless limitations of art within a corporate structure, which included a stop-motion animation and an homage to ‘24’. In February he made his feature directorial debut, writing and directing romantic drama ‘The Escort’ which is due to be completed next month, and has since been working on various projects with the intent of making ‘Mute’ his next film.Link to a clip of my last feature 'The Escort':https://youtu.be/A4Vx-J8Imv8Laura De Casto (Consulting Producer) is the former MD of Tartan Films, overseeing many major releases that were brought to Western audiences including 'The Grudge', 'The Ring', and 'Battle Royale'. A film producer, Laura's credits include 'Guy X' with Jason Biggs and Michael Ironside, and 'Boogie Woogie' starring Gillian Anderson and Amanda Seyfried. She also acted as a Consulting Producer on my last feature, ‘The Escort’.Raffaello DeGruttola (Actor) is a highly versatile actor who has appeared in a number of movies including the Ron Howard film ‘Rush’, ‘Saving Private Ryan’, ‘Quantum of Solace’, and appeared opposite John Malkovich in action thriller ‘Unlocked’. The role of the salesman, Monette, is an incredibly challenging role as we witness the evolution of a highly stressed individual unfold over the course of one night with three interlinking tales told – the dissolution of a marriage, his relationship with a hitcher, and his confession to a priest – all of which will push him mentally to the brink. As the only speaking person of the duo in the car much rests on his shoulders which I am excited to see him explore.Kevin Leslie (Actor) is an award-winning performer having won Best Actor at the Marbella Film Festival for his portrayal of Reggie Kray in the film 'The Rise of the Krays', a role he would reprise the following year in 'The Fall of the Krays'.Having played the male lead in ‘The Escort’, a highly dialogue-driven film, Kevin will take on a character who is the polar opposite to that role, portraying the mute hitcher with a secret where all his thoughts and feelings are conveyed through his face and body.Simona Roman (Actress) co-starred with Wesley Snipes in the vampire horror 'Gallowwalkers' and has also appeared in 'The IT Crowd', 'Footballers' Wives' and 'Casino Royale'. Playing Barb, the wife of Monette who is engaged in a sordid affair and embezzlement scandal Simona will play two versions of the character - the woman in Monette's mind who torments him with her crimes thus justifying his animosity towards her, and the real Barb: a flawed yet sympathetic woman whose lack of love from her husband caused her to make a mistake which she is striving to escape from.Olivia Moyles (Actress) previously appeared in 'The Rise of the Krays' and played the titular character in ‘The Escort’. While Monette’s daughter was referenced in the story the role has been expanded in this adaptation in order to witness the effect her parents’ marriage – and their sins – will have on her.Dane Gerous Schmidt (Composer) is an award-winning composer with a penchant for various genres and a specialty for suspense. A graduate of K-State University, Dane also owns a record label, Gerbil Hamster Records. His music will help add to the tension in 'Mute' and externalize the salesman’s troubled mind.Rebecca Hadfield (Hair and Makeup Artist) is a graduate of the prestigious Christine Blundell Makeup Academy with extensive experience in film, TV, commercials, and theatre. Her recent credits include being a Hair and Makeup Trainee for Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' starring Emma Watson, DC's 'Wonder Woman', and 'Paddington 2'. She was also the make-up artist on ‘The Escort’.Stewart Allan (Assistant DOP) is a documentary filmmaker. Having worked for Channel 4 in the past Stewart has since gone on to film a variety of shorts, and more recently completed a documentary feature on long distance running. He currently freelances as a lighting cameraman for various corporate and educational projects.John Bucknall (Storyboard Artist) is an artist and photographer whose keen eye for detail made him a crucial element of the team, having already collaborated with him before as his storyboards helped bring ‘The Escort’ to life.","There are inarguably many challenges in the making of any film, with the biggest obstacles based on overcoming budget constraints and ensuring that the movie is completed. In this case having already directed a feature this year I have faced a series of seemingly insurmountable challenges before and learned from that experience in order to make a film which I am immensely proud of. I have also made other shorts and produced a feature in the past so am prepared for many of the challenges associated with making this film. My background also makes me suited to handling the budget – with a Maths degree, an MBA, and a background in finance I have proven experience in handling resources, and have met with production companies to discuss their own financing. However this is further aided with the involvement of Laura De Casto who as the former MD of Tartan Films can also provide another perspective to ensure the film is completed on time and on budget, while the professional talent attracted ensure the film created will be as intended in order to achieve the lofty aspirations deserving of this story. While I intend all elements of the film to be completed by July 2018 I have set a delivery date of August 2018 in order to ensure the digital downloads and all other rewards are received by that time. I will also provide frequent updates via Facebook, Twitter, and this page so that you may follow and interact with us throughout the journey as the film is created and released within this timeframe."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904669009/prototype-of-self-charging-ecological-accumulator?ref=discovery_category_newest,904669009/prototype-of-self-charging-ecological-accumulator,"First of all, I apologize for my imperfect English! We all know the batteries and use them for many years, compared to the very first private electric accumulators now they are high capacity, safer, smaller, lighter, and thanks to the lithium ions can be very different forms from the standards, being able to be inserted into objects of all kinds. A feature never changed so far is that sooner or later they all come down, and must be recharged from an external source such as power supplies, chargers, solar panels, power bank, etc. or replaced, with the difficulties we all know and which we consider inevitable. Unfortunately I do not have videos or images because everything is still in progress, a working prototype for now but has yet to be patented ... what am I talking about? I designed a battery that recharges without any kind of external source, without wires, without solar panels, without a pedal or a crank dynamo ... simply stopping to use it! It stops for a few hours and recharges, it is also partially self-charging even when not used at maximum capacity! It is very useful, necessary, but above all avoids waste of money and helps to pollute less, and the final cost of this battery will not be prohibitive ... everyone can buy it and everyone can use it! This is my motto! Think of all the objects that work with standard-sized batteries such as flashlights, outdoor lighting for the home, radio and portable TV, lots of toys for children, headlights for bikes that often leave us in the dark because the batteries do not they last a long time and the dynamo lamps make you struggle to ride more and in any case the lights go out as soon as the bike stops at an intersection .... they are just a few examples, but look around the house, during your life every day ... sometimes replacing a battery can be complicated because you have to disassemble some components to get to the battery compartment, and intosome cases you need screwdrivers because the cover is fixed with a screw, and a simple operation can become complex and take longer than expected. Finally think of the poor, in countries with little technology or living in a state of backwardness, people who stop working when the sun sets and illuminate the house by lighting the fire or with small flashlights, but once the batteries run out or they have no money to buy them back or it is not easy to buy new ones, and they certainly do not have electricity to recharge them, spare batteries or bulky solar panels ... think also about researchers, explorers, hikers and athletes who work at night and have to do reliance on safe sources of light. Who works in construction sites at night, or speleologists, farmers, who must perform maintenance work in cellars or garages, in case of natural disasters, collapses of buildings, rescue activities, bring the dog for a walk in the evening, a light of emergency in the car, illuminate the garden at night because they heard suspicious noises, or where you need electricity and there is no electricity or you do not want to make holes in the wall for electric cables how to mount wireless video surveillance, Children's games will last longer for a long time and parents will not have to stop them from playing because they waste too much money on batteries. Once I've created my prototype, I'll be able to build more and more powerful and large batteries to run industrial equipment, our cars, often stopped for exhausted batteries or simply because we forgot to turn off the lights with the engine off .... with my battery you will have to wait a bit 'of time, without asking for help, without connecting the electric cables, without having to bring another machine to move our! I have not mentioned smartphones and mobile phones, because for now they use too small, thin and incompatible batteries for my project, they also have different connections","I want to reassure all my supporters that I have been working for a long time on the feasibility of my idea and intuition, I need only a garage or small empty warehouse where you can have space to complete and test the prototypes, and funds to buy material to produce this battery in series, even if only to start this potential business to be able to enlarge in the future once entered the market and advertised my product.As you can see from the movies and photos I'm making some pieces at a turner that is far from my home in the spare time, fortunately has agreed to make me make the pieces that I need alone to save a bit, but it is still expensive because I have to pay in addition to the raw parts, even the hourly rate for the time and electricity I use his tools, also every time I have to get over 50 miles round trip and I have to include the cost of fuel, and I do not always have time, and not always the equipment is free because even the owner craftsman uses it for his work, rightly so my times are lengthened, and also the money that I'm spending. But thanks to your help I can buy equipment also secondhand, more modern and configurable with a computer, smaller size, so I can work near home and the tools are always available when I have time, even in the evening and during the weekends.  Unfortunately as a geologist I do not earn much and the state, the bureaucracy, the accountant and the many expenses take me away more than half of my small profits and I can not afford to invest in this project .... so much so that as the only means of transport I have an old but reliable 1992 Ford Transit fueled with petrol and gpl !!! I need your help in order to be able to face the bureaucracy between the patent and the strict and numerous tests of safety and suitability necessary to commercialize the my innovative battery. And this bureaucracy related to the necessary tests and approvals could be delayed in the marketing of the product, it is a long and very complicated process, but thanks to your help I will exceed it! And once you have completed all this, you my supporters will be the first to possess, use and be proud of having contributed to the realization of a dream, but above all to have contributed to the health of our beloved planet, and to make an object as useful as batteries, even more efficient and even more ecological ... just think of how many objects around you are running on battery, and how many times they have been stuck for a low battery..and how much money we spend to buy other batteries or electricity to recharge them!If I succeed in realizing my project as I have conceived it, as soon as possible I will enlarge, I will look for a bigger shed and I will be able to offer work both to general workers who will need designers and other qualified professional figures.I present a short work plan: if thanks to you supporters I will reach the required amount in the pre-established times I can immediately look for a small warehouse, buy the necessary equipment to start building a suitable prototype and as much as possible in the final form, in different sizes and powers, the basic equipment will be 3D printer and related plastic consumer material, work tables, basic tools of those I have not yet, various electronic components made to measure for my project, all this takes about 1 or 2 months, after which if the prototypes work properly and are safe the bureaucratic part begins but I can not tell you how long it will last because it depends on the patent office, the body that must certify security and functionality, etc .... finally there is more or less production mass, advertising, decisions like dimensions, powers, etc ... and contact potential big customers to create specimens with their specific requests as dimensions , forms, powers, etc ... which I expect in about 3-4 months to start.The main risks are not to pass the safety certifications on the first attempt, but just make the changes that they themselves will indicate.Other difficulty can be 'initial indifference of people who do not trust a new product, never seen ... and that's why I need the right certifications, as well as for safety, also to show potential buyers who can trust, that is reliable even if new! And I have to rely on marketing professionals because they know what themes to insist on and how to present my product ... I'm just a humble geologist, and I would risk presenting badly or not highlighting the positive aspects of my idea, but advertising experts must be paid!If you have any questions, please ask me, I will answer you as soon as possible!Thank's for your time and support.It's very precious for me.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904669009/handmade-lectern-in-aluminium-and-plexiglass-led-f?ref=discovery_category_newest,904669009/handmade-lectern-in-aluminium-and-plexiglass-led-f,"Hello everyone! I apologize for my imperfect English. Like many people I love outdoor life, doing sports, hiking, .... but also reading books both at home and outdoors ... so the My brain has set in motion to find a solution to some small difficulties of everyday life. I have devised, designed and finally created with my hands a small craft object, which has existed for a long time, but updated with recent technologies and materials and made more functional, lightweight, and versatile for different uses.New so new ... just ""updated""! My hand made lectern is made of solid and lightweight aluminum and plexiglass.The prototype that I show in this campaign is natural aluminum color and tailor-made for me, but if my Kickstarter campaign will be successful I will be able to make it tailored to the specific requests of the client, just because it will not be produced in series, but according to the preferences of the applicant from time to time. It can be taller, wider or longer, the aluminum parts can be painted with the preferred color, the Plexiglas parts can be transparent or translucent or that do not pass light, as well as colored.","The challenges I have to face are many, but not insurmountable.If this fundraising will be successful, first of all I will have to look for a small rented warehouse where you can finally work in a suitable space, after which I will have to buy work tables, adequate equipment precision but always for artisan work, consumables such as aluminum profiles, plexiglass in large slabs etc ...., a 3D printer to independently produce the plastic parts and possibly customize the designs and colors according to the requests of the customers, set up a warehouse area for painting, both powder and spray and buy materials and equipment, choose the most reliable suppliers and with the highest quality materials. One of the first objectives will be to obtain certifications of suitability and safety by the authorities. Last but not least there is the bureaucracy, security systems, organize an area in which to handle the shipping between packaging made on purpose and a space in which to store from the raw material to the finished product ready for shipment. Finally there is the waste disposal talk in an area of ​​the warehouse in which to separate aluminum from plastic, paper, plexiglass, etc. ...The risks are not being able to organize everything by myself, but I'm sure I can count on at least 2 other employees, initially part time, and according to the reservations of my lectern can become full time.Other little inconvenience is the time necessary to the bureaucracy to get permits and checks, but with my work as a geologist I'm used to safety and safe product testing."

The moment Moshe experienced the large open spaces, all the green fields and the changing landscapes he knew he had to start taking pictures; and if not for himself, then for the family and friends.Taking breathtaking photos wasn’t enough for Moshe, something was missing, and soon he understood what it was. Taking photos and viewing them through your computer screen is fun, but it’s lacking the physical experience of holding a picture, the reason for capturing a moment – to suddenly see it and relive your experience, by printing and hanging the photo. It reminded him he missed the old days when he used to go to the local camera store and develops his rolls of films from when he went on trips with friends and family. These where not professional, but they had meaning. They showed moments of love, happiness, sadness, fun and moments you took for granted (before you saw the pictures).Nikon D800e, was the turning point of Moshe Levis’s photography. His first professional full frame digital camera. It symbolized a new era, success, new goals and dreams, love (for he purchased the camera with the love of his life), and last but not least, the capability of printing his master pieces landscape and fine art photography on a much larger scale. This is when Moshe Levis really started his most challenging adventure yet.As a photographer I can't stand low quality prints when I see them. If the quality is not good enough just don't print it. Keep it on your computer.The production of this book is a bit expensive because I'm going after the best quality for my photography prints.

Literally a gallery on wheels, it travels throughout Southern California hosting classes and discussions and curating exhibits. Her goal is to provide a complete outlet for artists including web pages, links, and media from their show in her trailer. Expect local artists whose work reflects the location in which the gallery is positioned. Photography, paintings, and sculpture have all been displayed. The rolling gallery often coordinates its shows with other exhibits near its parking spot, offering in effect a satellite exhibition that compliments a museum show or gallery opening. Colston calls her exhibiting artists “Trail Blazers,” but surely she is one, too."" -Genie Davis, CBSLA.We have all agreed that if we pay our staff the minimum amount possible and invest in our readers, tutorials, contests, IT, advertisement etc we'll be able to keep on going and strive to making NOTINDOOR photography magazine, the #1 landscape and fine art photography magazine in the world.Plus,that gives us enough time to gain more trust, prove our good work and make financial predictions.This is what Kickstarter is all about, right?! Kickstart your business.These costs are for:Q. Why do you care so much about photographers?A. Simply put, we are photographers. We know all about photographer's pain points, disappointments and financial difficulties.Q. What's in it for the backers?A. Being a backer of this Kickstarter campaign not only grants you the goodies/perks/purchases/rewards that you choose but also make you the most important element in the success of NOTINDOOR. Thanks to our backers, photographers all over the world will have not only a great magazine to read, view and learn from, but also an amazing platform where they can be appreciated for their work.Not just another ""your photos are awesome. Thanks"" kind of website.Q. Won't paying for every contribution to your magazine decrease the quality and value of your magazine?A. Absolutely not. When contributors submit articles, videos, photos etc their submissions must be approved by our staff to determine what's good for our readers and what's in high quality content.Think about it, every newspaper has a lot of writers and photographers (and much more). They all get paid. Right?Q. How can we make history?A. As far as we checked, no other free monthly issued magazine had successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign. In fact, there was no otherfree monthly issued magazine Kickstarter campaign at all. With your help, we can achieve that.Plus, there is no other free magazine that pays every single published submission, from the smallest photo to the longest article. With your help, we can do that too.Q. Why only online magazine and no prints?A. There are 2 huge factors for this question and we'll give you both answers:1. NOTINDOOR Photography Magazine is determine to help save the planet as much as possible. Some of the main parts of our planet are the oceans and forests. Lets start with trees, by not printing our magazine we help protect a few more trees. Of course it's not enough, but it's a start. And we'll be more proactive as we go.If we do start print publications we'll only print on recycled paper.2. The direction our future goes to is definitely digital. New magazines that start printing productions have a much higher risk in failing and loosing big investments of time and money. It is obviously possible but since more and more people read their news and magazines on their iPads and other e-readers it makes more sense, business wise, to go on the digital rout.","The biggest challenge, as a starting magazine, is to find sponsors that can support the magazine and help it grow. Nowadays, (maybe in past years too) unfortunately, it's all about the numbers. Less about the quality.Another challenge is to get amazing articles each and every month. Established magazines have piles of articles waiting to be published, while the starting publications have to find good material all the time.It's a challenge but, we have overcame it every single month!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729231585/never-trust-a-stranger?ref=discovery_category_newest,729231585/never-trust-a-stranger,"The following probably describes my project quite well. It's from the reader who analyzed my script for The Bluecat screenplay contest.From my Bluecat Screenplay contest entry reader comments:What did you like about this script?  Bobby is not a traditional leading man; he is a homeless vet who gets sucked into a plot to rob some powerful gangsters. He has a heart of gold, but there is an underlying darkness to him. He is capable of horrible acts without batting an eye. We see this dichotomy throughout the script. It begins when he agrees to help Alex’s “family” because he is led to believe they are in trouble, but once they double cross him he shows no mercy. He’s a great character that you want to like, but would be terrified if he was not on your side. The opening scene captures his characterization perfectly. He is in the midst of a suicide attempt, and after it fails, he knows he has more work to do in life.This scene is a great character establishing moment, and it really sets the tone for the rest of the script. Dialogue stands out. Each character has a unique voice. Bobby talks like a homeless man who has lost his family and life. The gangsters talk like mobsters. Joplin talks like a punk rocker girl. You have done great work with matching each character’s dialogue to their characterization. Another great aspect of your dialogue is that it enhances the story instead of focusing on needless exposition. The pace of the script moves quickly. There is never a dull moment, and the action really keeps the audience engaged. Nice work on pushing the gas pedal down and never letting up. The tension also builds to the climax well. It feels like Bobby and his accomplices are in danger at every turn. With the attention you have paid to tension and pace, you have crafted a wonderful crime drama. ","Quite honestly, once funding is in place, challenges will be minimal. Probably the biggest challenge is getting known actors, producers and directors to work for minimal pay. Often, they will work for free if they truly believe in the project. I already have a well known producer who will join us once we have funding. He's read the script and optioned it, though his option just ran out.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729231585/monsters-3?ref=discovery_category_newest,729231585/monsters-3,"CHILD ABUSEBefore the age of 18…1 out of every 4 girls is sexually abused...1 out of every 6 boys is sexually abused...1 in 5 children are solicited sexually while on the internet...The median age for reported child abuse is 9 years old...30-40% of victims are abused by a family member...50% are abused by someone outside of the family whom they know and trust...Nearly 70% of child sex offenders have between 1 and 9 victims…at least 20% have 10 to 40 victims...An estimated 42 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse exist in America today.

These will be the resources we will supply for them. Computers, StudioTime. Cameras, Arts & Crafts. Office Supplies, Food & Shelter.Our next goal would to be to create a media outlet to spread the word ofLife Behind The Grind In Hollywood as a TV Show, a Talk Show as well as the discoveryof New talent in a live broadcast Talent Show.As we all know there are many Homeless people in the streets of America. What we fail to realize and recognize is out of all the homeless you see more than half of them are very talented creative entities which could ultimately shape our world.Being one of these entities, i see so much creativity and future novelist, Directors, Models and so on when i come across these individuals. So i want to raise awareness not only in my area but throughout the entire world. But in the meantime one step at a time starting with my Kickstarter program.Below are LBTGIH magazine covers but i need help financing to get them completed and published. Awareness is key and with your help i can finally introduce full completed Magazines to the public for their enjoyment.THE ORGINS OF LBTGIH:Chyna McCoy, a well-established filmmaker decided to go on an incredible journey to finance his own film without going the typical Hollywood route which involved moving to LA, getting an Apartment with roommates and going on the same auditions that everyone in Hollywood was going on.In 2014, Chyna decided to buy a Truck and live out of it while chasing one of the most unfathomable and unreachable dreams considered by many as impractical and insane. Byproducing and funding his own film and doing things his way, Chyna took on this task and proceeded on his Journey.While following his destined path, he realized there are so many others like him on that same incredible journey. With an already successful film career as a stunt coordinator, action fight choreographer, and actor, Chyna who did the action fight stunt doubling for ((Laurence Fishburne/Morpheus)) in The Matrix decided to go on a crusade to bring awareness to the world about Homeless talented people in Hollywood through his brochures and recently publicized magazines.Chyna has put all his efforts into bringing light to a Non-Profit organization called Actor’s Haven, which will have all the homeless talent under one roof where they can explore their creative freedom without worry or distractions.",Now there are many risks and challenges in bringing this into fruition. One the Government may not approve the paperwork to move forward or the time it takes for this to come in to full bloom may take longer than expected but know that i will be posting updates of my progress as i strive toward making this a reality for all especially my Homeless talent not only out here in the streets of Hollywood but the entire nation.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/KillerofKillers/bayne-legacy-apocalypse-in-japan?ref=discovery_category_newest,KillerofKillers/bayne-legacy-apocalypse-in-japan,"This is a Sample done by 2D Artist Jay Reed. His Style is fantastic but it will take more than one person too bring Bayne to life. So travel with me on the journey to a successful campaign and let's get to Japan and make Bayne an Animated series.WHAT I AM DOING HAS NEVER BEEN DONE:This grand adventure i want to partake in has never been done. The majority of the people go with people they know (Association) to get projects in the door, while others go through Agents and Managers.The route i chose is to go directly to the Animated source and make it happen but once again i can not do this without the help of all my friends, family and fans.FINANCES:As i said in the video, my main goal is to walk away from Japan with multiple Animated studios bidding on Bayne. Each and every $Dollar will be used for, Room and Board, Food and other materials needed too meet with the Animatedcompanies.Transportationas well as paperwork to travelabroad.STAY:My plan is too be in Tokyo Japan for 3 months and apply every bit of knowledge to knock down doors and bring eyes and ears on The Bayne Legacy Project.DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE:The only way i can accomplish this impossible yet possible task is with your help by spreading the word and donating and contributing to bring Bayne to Japan and making history","Thanks again for stopping by and taking the time to see what this campaign and my venture is about.  I am hoping there won't be any snags after the Bayne project is fully funded. But if anything can go wrong will go wrong such as delayed flights, Paperwork as far as going over seas pushed back due to clerical errors.The are many possibilities but the hopeful is for none of these to happen and we will be able to get to Japan and when i say we i mean you my backers as i will be filming the entire event.So bear with me and let's make this a reality."

Would you call or fold? This is what our Poker training application helps teach you.","We have been invited to have a booth at a WSOP Circuit event in Baltimore MD.

First, we have to finalize the design. The prototype has showed proof of concept. We have already added several updated features to improve the functionality of the device. We added some no slip pads, and some snaps to ensure the unit stays flat and closed when not in use. We also are working on a prototype that will be a little bigger than a credit card, but will be able to accommodate a bigger tablet than just an iPad mini. The manufacturer that we are using is located in Bristol, PA. They helped with the final design, and created the prototype. The prototype had to be machined by hand. Once we reach our funding goal, we can mass produce the product. We also welcome any suggestions from our funders. Since the molds haven't been created yet, it's a perfect time to make suggestions. The molds will take about eight weeks to create, so we are hoping to have them created by the holidays. ","With every new product, there is a chance that it won't be popular.  Here are the risks that we have identified and our solutions:Risk:Knock offs, or replicasMitigation:Mobile Hang is currently under Patent Pending protection.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dmurray12/grandparents-lets-talk?ref=discovery_category_newest,dmurray12/grandparents-lets-talk,"I'm putting together a Talk Show Forum for grandparents and parents.It's to discuss why grandparents aren't being allowed to see their grand kids. I found out that this is a big problem and it's growing in leaps and bounds. And know one is talking about it,or trying to fix it. Well that's what I want to do. I want to talk about it and help fix this problem. And here is my plain.I want the parents discuss why they aren't allowing the grandparents to see their grand kids. In addition I want the grandparents to tell the parents how this is affecting them both mentally and physically. And with that it will open up the lines of communication. And potentially they'll be able to come to some kind of agreement. Because they're both working on the same thing. What's best for the children. And having the parents and grandparents on a one on one discussing without any immediate outside influences.Now in case you don't know where're losing our kids at an alarming rate. That's why it's so important for us to work together. We need unity not division. Divided we fall. United we stand. Through out the years we've heard people say it takes a Village to raise a child. And this day and time we need that more than ever. As much as we would like to be with our kids 24 hours a day seven days a week. It's just not possible. At Some point and time we have to leave them. Yes,we worry where ever they go. But when we allow our kids to visit certain people we worry less.Tell me this, Do you really want your kids to grow up and not know who their grandparents are? No you don't. Parents when we're raising our kids they don't have a voice. We talk for them and they do what we say. But as a parent it's our responsibility to make the best decision for our kids. And to not make decisions based on anger. We are all guilty of that. When we make decisions out of anger,we have a tendency to over react. Things are said and communications stop.We all need a good family support system,but that system should also include the grandparents. And until you become a grandparent you will never quite understand the relationship between that child and that grandparent.I've given you a break down as to how the show will work. I need your support to help make this a reality because there are so many parents and grandparents that need this.                       Thank You",Your support will help me with submitting my idea to networks and producers.  With what we face on a day to day with our kids they're in need of all the help they can get. I'll keep you updated on my progress. And when the show is picked up you will be the first to know. Had I not experienced this I wouldn't be here. But I did. And i know how those grandparents feel. I have walked in their shoes and I have felt their pain. And because of that this is very personnel to me. The funding is necessary because in order to submit my story there are fees associated with every submission. I have located  several producers and networks that allow you to submit your ideas. I will continue to search for more networks and producers. With your help my vision will become a reality. And I will keep you updated every step of the way.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dmurray12/your-bff-for-your-smart-phone-p2-powerx2?ref=discovery_category_newest,dmurray12/your-bff-for-your-smart-phone-p2-powerx2,"Hello my name is Denise and currently have an idea for more battery power in our smart phones. I call it the p2. The p2 will allow users to achieve additional battery life once the original battery gets to a certain level. ""for example""once the main battery reaches power saver mode. At the present time I do not have a prototype, which is why I""m asking you to back my project. And please not this idea/invention in no way will replace our chargers. The p2 is simply away to get more battery life during those moments when we need it most. Like the business traveler who's constantly on his/her phone, or that student who's battery is always running low. Because I don't have a prototype I can't submit my idea/invention to the developers. Which is why I need your help and support. Now, If you're wondering what the The p2 is. It's just a name I use to describe the specific components needed to achieve the additional battery life. Yes I know this is a complex project but with your support and backing the p2 can become and awesome tool for every smart phone user. Because of the fact that this product is under development pending your backing, I can't at this time offer a reward. But what I can do is this. At each step of this prototype development I will keep you updated. I will keep an active record of funds you donated to help me create a working prototype and at anytime upon request I will show you what funds have been used, and what they were used for. But the only way I can achieve this goal is with your help. I need your backing to help me create a prototype to submit to the developers. Because lets face it, at one time or another each of us have wished we had just a little more life on that battery. Have you ever tried to reach your child and they tell you their phone died which is why they didn't get your phone call. Well that's about to change. Just take a look, they're countless number of wireless chargers. So what happens when you leave it at home? Then what? With the p2 it comes pre-installed in your smart phone. The only way to leave your p2 at home is to leave your smart phone at home. We rarely do that. Because once we notice we don't have our smart phone. We're turning around and going back home to get that phone. So help me by backing my project and with the funds ""we"" together can change the world one battery at a time. The reason my funding goal is so high is because, phones by them self's are expensive, and i'm not sure how many I'll need or use. The specific components needed comes with a different prices. In addition to those few things I just mentioned , I would like to hire two college students. One who possess the skills needed to help me create a prototype. And one who's well versed in patents Laws and Non Disclosure Agreements. I want to make sure I'm protected and covered in all areas. Lets face it every where you look someone is trying to show you how to get more battery life. Case in point. See links below. That's why we need to create the p2 and bring it to the market. This idea/invention is the creation of my son and I. And If at any point you would like to speak with either of us I will gladly provide you with contact information. So please back my campaign so I can create the much needed prototype.","We haven't implemented the p2 because of funding. And I can't tell you for 100% certain that this will work. Technology is not my specialty. That falls on my son that's his specialty.  What I'll do is this. If you help me by funding my campaign I will personally keep you updated every step of the way. Failure is not an option.  We are going to bring a war to GOOGLE, APPLE, AND ANDROID.  And may the one with the most money WIN."

Kickstarter is a new way to fund creative projects through ""Crowd Funding"". Essentially, you pledge funds to help us develop and continue our journey to culinary success and we give you cool stuff in return. See over there on the right?When we reach our fundraising goal, you get the cool stuff and we get the financial support we need to complete our project. If we don't reach the goal, you don't lose any money (or get any cool stuff).  We can raise more than our target ($10k), so keep pledging if you want more cool stuff!We created this Kickstarter campaign to help fund the ongoing cost of opening a start-up restaurant and to get our friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, and local food lovers involved through a sense of collaborative ownership.   Nearly everyone we know has thought about owning a restaurant someday... now is your chance to own a small piece!  By funding our project this way, we can personally meet, thank, and celebrate with everyone who becomes a backer!This is a big project.  I've personally invested my own savings in this restaurant as have many of our closest family and friends, but we need a bit more to reach the finish line!  Money raised through Kickstarter will primarily be used as working capital, purchase a new smoker, a sausage maker (for our homemade Andouille and Boudin)and to add some much needed vintage decor to our little cafe! We've already completed so much, but we still need a bit of a push to really hit out stride.Help us make this city an even greater pillar of creativity and originality by supporting our project today.  We look forward to thanking you in person! ",In any startup business its a bumpy road for the first few months to say the least! We've had good success but we could also use this funding to help us keep our head above water until our little cafe can sustain itself.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neosoulcafe/viola-and-agnes-neo-soul-cafe-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,neosoulcafe/viola-and-agnes-neo-soul-cafe-0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy2fUmeTmyQJust a look at what we do! Thanks so much Joe!!!More than 18 years ago I started on my culinary journey. My mission was to gain a diverse experience working in some of the best restaurants. During my journey, I ventured to Maui, where I learned local dishes and preparations.  During my time on the island I worked along side Chef Raul Bermudez, a very well known and talented chef where I learned dishes from his family and it thought me how important family meals are with love ones... It was around that time that I embraced the name and the creation of Viola and Agnes' Cafe evolved.The dream I had on the islands has come true for me and my family in a way I could have never imagined! Here is Nassau Bay Texas for the last 3 and a half years the crew and I have worked so hard to be a great neighborhood cafe for our surrounding community and we are asking for a bit of help to keep the dream going! I received information about a potential space available just around the way from us so that we can keep the business right here in Nassau Bay where we feel it should be. I gathered my savings and investments, and I applied for a small SBA loan to cover the cost of unlocking the doors. Although excited, reality kicked in very fast. Nothing in the building was reusable. The space needed a total and complete makeover, all the old equipment and furnishings had to be removed– literally EVERYTHING!Accordingly, I have to start from scratch. The overwhelming number of changes and upgrades quickly blurred my vision of the beautiful family-owned restaurant that I always dreamed of; which is why I am reaching out to you on Kickstarter asking for your support. With your support and donations, Kickstarter will be used to purchase necessary kitchen equipment and will help “bring life” to the dining space by adding art, tiles and good ole southern charm to the space.Many prayers have made my dream a reality by bringing my exciting new restaurant to Nassau Bay But, it takes a community to raise a restaurant, which is why I need your help in order to bring the best new restaurant to Nassau Bay Tx.Help us reach $10,000 over our goal so we can get our outdoor seating ready for summer. Also to purchase our ""Soul 2 Go"" mobile! We have been thinking of doing our own togo delivery to the neighborhood so we can bring the food you love at the cafe directly to your door minutes after being garnished by chef!Without risk there are no rewards. Opening a restaurant is risky. With over ten years of experiences in the restaurant industry, I have confidence in my ability to provide extraordinary food, professional service, and to build a restaurant where guests are ALWAYS welcomed. I understand the inherent challenges in opening a restaurant, such as: staffing, construction delays, funds and many minor issues that can easily become major. However, I am confident that I will diligently work hard to ensure goals are timely met. I will also communicate in a timely manner any and all accomplishments and/or pitfalls.","Without risk there are no rewards. Opening a restaurant is risky.

As this normally takes a team to accomplish. But as a 1 man band at first I am willing to take the risk as I have studied mechanical engineering and it's understanding.

And even short testing can be done at the bay, this speeds up the manufacturing system on specialized vehicles, and makes keeping up with improvement data and information, imperfections, pre-modification and system error more quickly and efficiently. As for when it comes down to manufacturing machines in smaller quantity, it makes more sense to limit your facility space and focus on a suitable size to manufacture in detail.

","The most common risk for projects like this is the deadline, as a one man band it could be difficult to keep up with production. Although a small batch (possibly 9) would be made first, it still bring the risk of uncertainty that the project would be guarantee. Further down the line i would have an assistant to speed up the process. Second would be the R&D cost on materials and securing a contract with suppliers on specific parts, and the main rule is the bigger the capital raised means a huge launch of the project, and the less of capital raised means an unlikely chance of success."

The group consists of myself on Trumpet and Vocals, a Pianist, Double Bass - and a Vibraphone, which is 'oh so classy' ! This is the sort of line up Chet Baker used in the last 10 years of his life - no Drums - no bashing and thrashing !There are myriad small jazz groups around but, I am aware that the majority of these groups are just 'get together' groups who play the music mainly for the fun of it. Whilst I don't have a problem with this, most of the jazz ensembles around are extremely self indulgent. I am also aware that there is existent, a wide market for a classy 'lounge jazz' group which plays a genre of jazz which people without 'jazz beards' will find palatable. By focusing on one particular (and highly popular, it has to be said !) style of 'listenable' cool jazz, I am certain that, with a little help, I can establish this group throughout the Uk and Europe, with a very distinct possibility of the USA also.","Because this is now becoming a working band and thus, the project itself has to some great extent proved successful, I am in reality only seeking some help to increase awareness of the music, and this can be done most effectively through local, national and international Jazz based Radio Stations. Additionally, the benefit of me having a 'video' to add to the new website I have acquired (www.ChetBakerSongbook.com) when it is launched in August/September, will give me an unparalleled advantage against other Jazz style groups who have no website or, meaningful publicity exposure.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1663047277/the-nelson-riddle-songbook-nelson-riddle-tribute-o?ref=discovery_category_newest,1663047277/the-nelson-riddle-songbook-nelson-riddle-tribute-o,"I acquired sole rights to use the name 'The Nelson Riddle Tribute Orchestra'. I had to fight a lengthy battle in the High Court to achieve this ! I handled the bulk of the legal argument myself because, I sincerely believe that a high quality orchestra is required in the Uk and Europe, to continue the legacy of fine music left to us by the genius Nelson Riddle.However, in the latter stages of the matter, it became too stressful for me, and I employed a Lawyer and Barrister. Although I had prepared and tabbed most of the documentation, and I had won the first 2 stages of the argument, the costs for the Lawyer and Barrister amounted to almost £130,000:00.I have operated a Music Productions company since 1998, and during this time I have formed several orchestras including : The Glenn Miller Tribute Orchestra : The Memphis Belle Swing Orchestra (which performed in the Blockbuster Movie) : The New Squadronaires Orchestra (which is a registered trademark owned by me) : The National Concert Orchestra of Great britain (a 30 piece orchestra which plays popular light music and is well known for it's 'Vienna Proms' concerts) : The Bert Kaempfert Tribute Orchestra : The Kings of Swing Orchestra (registered trademark owned by me) : The Nelson Riddle Tribute Orchestra. I have also produced and own rights to several musical stage shows :The Bobby Darin Songbook : The Kings of Swing (Rat Pack) show : Legends of Las Vegas : The Vienna Proms : A Festival for Christmas : Swing into Christmas : A Bert Kaempfert Gala Concert.My main raison d'etre seems to have been, to create valuable work opportunities for young aspiring musicians. Over the past 20 years or so, I have created millions of pounds worth of work and opportunities for young musicians. At one point, I was paying out around £1 million annually in 'wages' to these musicians. However, music tastes do change, and I have always sought to keep up to the times - to a degree. It is evident to me, and has been for this past few years, that the audience for the 1940's genre of music (ie: Glenn Miller etc) is on the wane. Thus, I have gently steered our range of product toward a slightly younger age group. I have done this by presenting a wider range of musical concerts relating to the 1960's 'swing era' and shows such as 'The Bobby Darin Songbook' and 'The Bert Kaempfert Gala Concert' are proving to be very popular.The matter of myself and my company having to pay out a very large amount of money to Lawyers, in order to protect our own interests, has meant that we have never actually recovered financially from that episode. Also, my policy has been one of pricing my orchestras and shows reasonably, so as to (a) create more work opportunities and (b) to make them appeal to a wider but perhaps less wealthy and pampered audience. As you will know, most orchestras in Great Britain are funded by the Tax Payer via local councils and the Arts Council. Many of these orchestra receive circa £3million (plus) and the music they play is very narrow and elitist. The ticket prices are generally so high as to preclude many of the people who would like to see a live orchestra perform. There is no support from the 'Arts' or any other 'body' for 'Light Popular' and 'Easy Listening' music whatsoever !The point I am getting to is this : that I have created a wealth of work and musical products over the years, but I have not done this with the prime motive of lining my own pockets - as many others have. My legacy I hope, will be, that I have generated a vast amount of opportunities for young musicians who otherwise, might well have given up their art for lack of opportunities elsewhere in Great Britain. Also, that I have perpetuated the amazing legacy of music and talent left to us by our forebears - people like Nelson Riddle.For those who are not aware, Nelson Riddle was the world famous conductor and music orchestrator for FRANK SINATRA, NAT KING COLE, ELLA FITZGERALD, SHIRLEY BASSEY, MATT MONRO and an absolute host of big names. I sincerely believe that we must keep this genre of music alive, and we ought preserve the integrity of such great musicians.My proposal is to raise a minimum of £20,000:00 which would definitely 'kickstart' the working prospects of the orchestra. That figure, would enable me to record a C.D. and DVD recording of the Orchestra, featuring 2 of my vocalists (boy and girl). That is nowadays, an essential part of any orchestra's 'armoury'. But further, it would also enable me to present 3 live concerts in large theatres and concert halls in the Uk. It is intended to present these inaugural concerts of The Nelson Riddle Songbook in 3 major cities. These seem most likely to be Manchester, Glasgow and Norwich because, our past 20 years or so of experience, tells us that these 3 cities have a very large following for this style of music. It is intended to present these 3 concerts during April 2014 but, it is also essential to bear in mind, that these venues need to be booked at least six months in advance.The costing here is approximate but, it is very close to actual costs :Theatre hire costs : are nil because, we do percentage deals with all theatres we work with. Normally, the percentage split is 80/20% in our favour. In simple terms this means, we take a 80% cut of the box office/ticket sales turnover. This is the usual manner in which shows appear in theatres in the Uk.Cost of musicians/singers/crew(per event) : £3000:00Total cost to present 3 events : £9000:00DVD costs to professionally record one show : £2000:00CD recording costs incl. musician's fees/studio costs : £4500:00Thus, the total cost projected is approximately £15,500:00 to launch and establish the orchestra, but prudently, allows some leeway for hidden costs along the way.With the benefit of a DVD and CD recording, together with the publicity generated, it then becomes a much a simple matter to also sell the Orchestra and the production into theatres and to concert promoters in the UK and Europe.There would be no delays with this project because, I have over 200 transcribed scores of music written by Nelson Riddle. The orchestra is already formed and has performed at several small venues in the U.k. as mentioned earlier in this description. However, this orchestra and it's presentation of 'The Nelson Riddle Songbook' has the potential to become a major attraction to people, both in the Uk and Europe, who like 'Easy Listening' and Swing music from the era. As you will note, the publicity has been prepared, the orchestra is already featured on the website (www.UkMusicProductions.co.uk) where you can also see the other orchestras and success stories we've created over the years.Thank you music lovers everywhere !Greg FrancisYou can check my own biography on the Robert Farnon website 'Legends of Light Music' :http://www.rfsoc.org.uk/gfrancis.shtml","There are absolutely no grounds for expectation of any delays in seeing forward any part of this project. I personally have over 200 music scores of the most popular songs and tunes which Nelson Riddle was associated with. All of the music scores are exact transcriptions of Nelson Riddle's Orchestrations, and some have even been cross referenced with the original scores which exist in the Nelson Riddle Archive at Arizona University. In this, the head of the archive (Keith Pawlak) has been a helpful colleague to me.  To restate the risk/challenge situation, the Orchestra is already formed and has performed several dates so far, mainly backing a stage show known as 'The Bobby Darin Songbook' in Warner Hotels. It has been rebooked so far at every venue ! However, we need your help to promote the Orchestra as a well established and working entity in it's own right. We're ready to go - when you are.Thank you again."

We would also like to reverse this affect with the Apple Watch. You wont need to buy a second watch for when you go to the gym or doing some other mundane activity that will get your watch damaged. you just need to slip on a matted stainless steal crown and wont have to worry about damaging your device. you can just change the Crown if damaged. We are using 3D printing to make this idea possible and to also give you a variety of options. steelGoldGold,There may be a few issues with the printing process with certain materials and would need to use a trial and error method to get it right. we don't want to make the crown too thick which in return will make it much heaver and expensive to produce and we also don't want to make it to thin in which case will make it not so protective and damage easily. we will also need to purchase a Apple Watch And create special Packaging For the higher end materials. (we would like your advice on how the packaging should look leave us a message describing you design),https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1090911217/apple-watch-crown-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1090911217/apple-watch-crown-0,"Welcome to The Apple Watch Crown Campaign.A little bit about myself I am a Additive designer or and a young engineer. I've been designing for about 4 years now and I've become really good at it. My experience and determination has lead me here, bringing one of my designs to life and creating a real product. The Apple Watch Crown, Because every King needs a Crown.About the Apple Watch Crown.The Apple Watch Crown was born from a idea that even if someone would buy the entry level Apple Watch Sport they can and should still have the option of making it personal. You can change the straps on your Apple Watch you can even change the clock face. In that case you should be able to change the case your apple watch comes in. There are a lot of cases and bumpers out there for the apple watch already. but they take too much away from the unique apple watch design. Most of them hides the beautiful esthetics that make the Apple Watch so beautiful, like the rotating crown and the curves of the watch. the apple watch crown takes these esthetics in to consideration and I have designed around them to keep most of Apple's design unchanged.The Apple Watch designed using SolidWorks And is manufactured by Shapeways. There are 4 different Alloys that Apple Watch Crown comes in: Steel, Gold Plated, Solid Gold, and PlatinumSteel is a very strong and robust material capable of withstanding all sorts of abuse. This will be a great option for the Apple Watch Sport. steel comes in a  different colors. Gold Steel, Black Steel, Nickel Steel, and Stainless Steel. The Gold Plated Crown is the mid range tier. this would be great for both the Apple Watch And the Apple Watch Sport. it's made from brass that is plated in 5 microns of your chosen color of Gold. colors include: 14K Yellow Gold,  14K Rose Gold, and 18K yellow Gold.Solid Gold Is the Top tier of the Apple Watch Crown. It is the best option for the Apple Watch. The solid Gold Apple Watch Crown comes in 14k Yellow Gold,  14K Rose Gold, and 18K yellow Gold.  Those are the options that are currently available we will be updating the page when new materials become available. We are Hoping  to raise about $20,000 to fund this project. These funds will go towards production, packaging, marketing, and hiring of other personnel to help out with the project. And please Be sure to share, this cant happen with out your help.",We may Have a few issues withe getting All the perks out on time I expect everything to be delivered by mid September but depending on Shapeways my manufacture. some of you who selected the gold plated options may have to wait a bit. especially the ones not in The USA. I will do my best to keep you up to date if that should happen.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1105629399/in-country-custom-furniture?ref=discovery_category_newest,1105629399/in-country-custom-furniture,"In Country Custom Furniture is an American- and veteran-owned custom carpentry business founded by Jeremy Kruid, a former marine who served in Afghanistan 2009. What started as a project for his wife and a passion for carpentry (and a hobby to mediate his arthritis and PTSD) turned into a business that’s growing faster than he can handle. With the money from this campaign, he’s going to expand the company’s shop and add new tools to speed up production time, keeping prices low and quality high.In Country Custom Furniture signature product – and the reward for a contribution to this campaign – is a made-to-order hardwood nightstand with a built-in wireless charger. These nightstands are made using of premium hardwoods like oak, cherry, hickory, and walnut, and embedded state-of-the-art wireless chargers. Thank you for reading more, and we hope you make a contribution to help empower an entrepreneur looking to fulfill a dream. I’ve been doing carpentry since I was 12, and what started as a hobby and way to spend time with my dad has turned into a passion and full-time business.My dad was a carpenter, and as a child, I would work alongside him as he built houses from the ground up. I didn’t follow his path as a young adult, but instead went into the Marines and served in Afghanistan for 9 months. I left the Marines in 2010, and hopped around the United States for several years, living in Texas, Louisiana, and finally Iowa, where I currently live with my wife and our dogs.Early last year, my wife was looking at our nightstands to upgrade our bedroom and, knowing about my history with woodworking, showed me a photo of a piece she loved and asked if I could make it. I happily agreed; stores like Ikea, Ashley Furniture, and other major retailers market furniture as “real wood” when they’re really selling veneer-covered particle board –sawdust that’s glued together and formed into boards. This outrageously priced furniture is low-quality, expensive, and quick to fall apart. I opted to bring her vision to life myself, using real wood and the tools in my small shop at home.After building a single piece, she asked me to build a set of nightstands for our guest room. Very quickly what started as a conversation on our couch turned into a full-time business. I now own and operate In Country Custom Furniture, a name that refers to my time in the combat zones of Afghanistan. “In country” refers to being in a combat zone while serving, and by company’s name commemorates my time overseas, the men and women who served alongside me, and those who served before and after me.Along with helping to support me and my family, my business improves both my physical and mental health. While serving, I developed arthritis and PTSD; working with my hands to build furniture keeps my arthritis at bay, and the soothing, almost meditative process of woodworking calms my PTSD.In Country Custom Furniture is first and foremost committed to quality, and that commitment is manifested in every purchase I make, from the lumber I work with to the adhesives and screws that hold them together.Locally sourced premium American woodI purchase domestic hardwood from a wholesale supplier in Sioux Falls, and I only use premium hardwoods like walnut, cherry, oak, hickory, and maple. This commitment to quality ensures my products last for several generations, and my local purchases help support other family-owned businesses.Ultra-slim state-of-the-art wireless chargersI use chargers that charge 10% faster than other options on the market, and ensure they’re placed perfectly within the nightstand to allow for the signal to reach your device. They’re compatible with all the most common phones, including but not limited to Android and Apple devices.Professional-grade componentsQuality is in the details. Every other element of my products, from the adhesives to the pocket screws to the hardware on the nightstand drawers, is top-notch. It’s this attention to the finishing touches that ensures my furniture stands the test of time. When you purchase a piece from In Country Custom Furniture, you can be confident you’re investing in the last nightstand you’ll ever buy.I’m raising funds to purchase new tools and equipment, and to improve my woodworking shop to increase my production capacity.CNC router: $2,000A CNC router is a computer-controlled machine that cuts wood and other hard materials with precision and consistency. It will replace my hand-held router, which is less accurate and much more time consuming.CNC laser engraver: $4,000Similar to a CNC router, a CNC laser engraver is a computer-controlled machine that engraves custom designs into hard materials like wood and metal. This tool will allow me to add embellishments, like monograms and engravings, to create even more customized pieces.Power planer: $2,700A planer is a tool used for shaping and smoothing wood. While manual planers are an option, a power planer speeds up this process and ensures a clean and beautiful finish every time.Power jointer: $1,000A jointer is used to make a lumber board straight, true, and uniform – a critical tool for making high-quality furniture that’s seen and used every day. Facility upgrades: Remaining fundsAll of these tools will be housed in an upgraded facility. I’ll use the remaining funds to modify my shop so it’s larger and easier to work in, helping me produce more quality furniture, faster.Pledge $35 or more: Love Dog Paw SignEst. delivery: March 2019We love our dogs and have one of these handmade wooden signs in our home.

This pledge level includes:While there are limited risks associated with this project, a few potential challenges include:Lumber prices: Volatility in the price of lumber may cause margin pressures.","Limited production capacity may cause delivery delays if orders exceed the $30,000 goal. Volatility in the price of lumber may cause margin pressures.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1105629399/rydz-marketplace?ref=discovery_category_newest,1105629399/rydz-marketplace,"The ride share market is broken in several ways. Uber and Lyft try to manipulate the market by setting prices and taking a portion of the revenues. What ends up happening is that you are over charged and drivers are under paid at the same time. Also, the Paypal or credit card payment requirements exclude many of the people that need rides. The current systems exclude anyone that does not have a bank account. These are the people that need ride share the most. Rydz Marketplace leaves open the option for cash payment that allows these people to access rides when they need them.Rydz Marketplace is a subscription based app is working to create an experience that is superior to that of those that are currently in common use.We are working to create an equitable solution to an industry that is not profitable or equitable for anyone.

By offering a subscription based app we can cover insurance and other other operating expenses while offering a ride at a fair price.How do we know it is a fair price? Drivers will be setting their own pricing and riders can choose if they want to pay their rate.Why $20,000? That is the estimated cost for a test market in Des Moines, Iowa. The registration fee is $5,000 plus insurance and advertising to attract drivers and passengers.",We may not be able to get enough traction to get reach the number of users necessary to make the app successful.There may be increased costs that prohibit my ability to finish the app.I have reached the limit of my coding skills so I will have to outsource the rest of the coding in the app.

Have you ever sipped Earl Gray from fine bone china, or did your mother ever bring you a cup of peppermint tea when you were sick in bed? Have you ever watched the marshmallows dissolve in a cup of cocoa while sitting next to a crackling fire, while outside snowflakes the size of pennies fell from a twilight sky? Have you ever shared a traditional Japanese chanoyu ceremony with a beloved friend? Its remarkable how often a warm cup of something has woven itself into the magical moments of life.Hello. My name is Cameron John Robbins. I am a figurative sculptor and portrait painter, and I have a vision I would like to share with you. I believe art and all things design are profoundly important parts of our lives. Such things remind us of the lives we want to live and help us to feel the way we want to feel. I hope to enlighten and ennoble the whole world through my work because those are some of the feelings my work inspires first in me. I also believe that if my work inspires me, it will inspire others. From the pictures we hang on our walls to the clothes we wear, art and design helps us to realize our dreams and be our best selves. Such things are expressions of who we are and who we hope to be. All of the art I create begins with a vision of something I actually want to have in my own home. Whether that vision is realized as a sculpture or a painting, it is always designed to resonate harmonically with living a beautiful, abundant and successful life. I am coming to you today because I want to share with you one of those visions, and I hope you will join me in my quest to create it. One of the more whimsical pieces I did some time ago was a tribute to all those hot tasty beverages we all love so much. Whether it is coffee, tea, or cocoa, a warm mug of something good just makes us feel safe and wonderful. La Mocha Grande was a 12” tall statue dedicated to those things.  Sadly, theoriginal statue I created was never molded or cast, and all I have left of itare these pictures. But I want to create it again, only this time as a 56” tallbronze. This is why I need your help. In order to create a statue of that sizeI need about $1,000 worth of clay and at least $300 to build the metalarmature, which is the skeleton of a sculpture that supports the weight of the clayform. That is why my first fundraising goal is$1,500.After the statue has been sculpted,it must be molded and cast in metal to make it permanent. Bronze is by far one of the mostbeautiful and durable metals for creating sculpture, but the costs of making abronze cast are high. I have contacted numerous foundries asking for bids onthis project, and depending on the foundry I use, the costs are estimated to beanywhere from $18,000 to $30,000 dollars for making a mold and producing onebronze cast. I will continue searching for the best foundry at the best price,but at this point I will need at least $20,000to create one bronze cast. That is my second goal, and I hope you will beinspired to help me make this statue a permanent monument to our favorite hotdrinks. A career in art is very much a fake-it-till-you-make-it gig. I have been pursuing my career as an artist for many years, and while I have worked diligently and the quality of my work has steadily improved, success of any kind has eluded me. My two biggest obstacles have been the material costs of producing my work, and the difficulty in acquainting a sufficient number of people with my existence and what I can create. A bronze statue as large as I intend to make La Mocha Grande would be a great help to my career because it would be something substantial I could submit to competitions, sell, or use to market myself to art galleries and collectors. None of us succeed in a vacuum. We all need the help and participation of other people to make our dreams come true. I hope you will not only help me make this dream come true, but that you will realize I am available to try and make yours come true also. Please feel free to contact me if you think I can be of assistance in that regard. After all, a huge part of what I do is functioning as an idea factory.My final goal is to make a secondbronze casting of La Mocha Grande, which will require an additional $14,000. I have a very special reasonfor wanting to make a second casting right away, which I will tell you about ina moment. First, I wish to describe the gifts I want to offer to you asexpressions of my gratitude for your help. Tier 1 ($10) donations will receive apostcard sized print of the drawing of LaMocha Grande with a hand written ‘Thank You’ note from me on the back.Tier 2 ($20) donations will receive theprint, and also a coffee cup with the drawing printed on the side.Tier 3 ($50) donations will receive theprint, the coffee cup and a travel mug with the drawing of La Mocha Grande oneach of them.Tier 4 ($100) donations will receive all ofthe preceding gifts, plus a tote bag with the drawing printed on its side.Tier 5 ($250) donations will receive 3 morecoffee cups, making a matched set of four.Tier 6 ($500) donations will receive all ofthe preceding gifts X2! Any or all of these pieces would make great gifts for the coffee lovers in yourlife.However,this is my special reason for wanting to cast a second edition of La Mocha Grande right away. Drum rollplease. If through your generoushelp we raise enough money to make two casts of La Mocha Grande, then I willtreat each donation as a raffle ticket, and one donor chosen at random willreceive the second cast of La MochaGrande FOR THEIR VERY OWN! That means we will need to raise around $34,000 to make that ‘Thank You’ giftpossible, but a $5 donation will have just as much chance to win as a $500donation. I would love to give that giftto one of you. To recap, mygoals are as follows:First Financial Goal: $1,500 – This will allow me to make a 56”tall clay sculpture of La Mocha Grande.First Expansion Goal: $20,000 – This will enable me to make a moldand one bronze cast of La Mocha Grande.Second Expansion Goal: $34,000 – this will enable me to make twobronze casts of La Mocha Grande,which will enable me to give the second 56” tall bronze statue to one of youlucky donors as my ultimate ‘Thank You’ gift. I thank youfor your consideration, and I look forward to thanking you for your support.Cheers.You may see most of my work atwww.facebook.com/CJRFineArt","Barring any unforeseeable delays, it will take 4-6 weeks for the clay and other materials to be delivered, and it will take me about 4-6 weeks to complete the sculpt. After the sculpt is finished and ready for the foundry to do it's work, it will be anywhere from 4-8 months before a bronze cast will be finished as dictated by the workload of the foundry. I will happily post regular updates and pictures to show the progress of this project.As for a delivery time on the 'Thank You' gifts, the biggest obstacles will be the time it takes for the items to be delivered by the printers, how long it takes me to write the 'Thank You' notes, and then to address and ship each package. I hope it is a gross overestimation, but I expect to have all 'Thank You' gifts delivered before February 2015, if not before.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cjrfineart/stronger-because-of-you-art-in-support-of-wounded?ref=discovery_category_newest,cjrfineart/stronger-because-of-you-art-in-support-of-wounded,"My name is Cameron John Robbins and I am a portrait painter. I want to create a solo show of twenty large portraits honoring one of the noblest groups of people I know of - wounded veterans. When the show is finished and made available for sale, I intend to donate all proceeds of those sales up to a total of $100,000.00 to the Military Order of the Purple Heart for the support of our wounded veterans. If donations to this Kickstarter campaign exceed the target of $20,000.00, then I will also donate 50% of that overage to the MOPH.My general vision for these portraits is reflected in the concept sketch detail below:Painting twenty large portraits is a substantial workload. That is why I will be dedicating the majority of my time during 2017 to creating this show, and limiting the number of paid commissions I take on. With that plan and timeline, this show will be ready for display in early 2018, and donors will be able to receive their prints by then.I can get by for a year on limited paid work, but I can't afford all that I need to do this project. This is why I need your help. For this project I need $20,000.00 to cover the cost of art supplies (canvases, brushes and paints), traveling expenses so that I can visit with and photograph the veterans who agree to pose for paintings, studio rental fees, and shipping and insuring of the paintings when they are finished. $20,000.00 can be a lot for any one person. But if we all give a little, we can make a big difference in the lives of those who have already sacrificed so much for us. Please help me honor those who have honored us so abundantly with their service and sacrifices.I am calling this project Stronger Because of You, which means three things: 1) We as a nation are stronger because of our veterans, 2) Our wounded veterans can be stronger because of our help and 3) We collectively are stronger because of the sacrifices of those who have gone before us defending the principles upon which our country was founded.I LOVE painting portraits! There are so many stories in the human experience to tell. Because I believe so passionately in human potential, I strive to make every portrait I paint dignified, ennobling and up-lifting. My belief is that if people can see themselves that way, then their lives will begin to reflect those qualities.One of the noblest groups of people I know of are veterans, especially wounded veterans. They exude such an inspiring spirit of pride and willing self-sacrifice. Unfortunately, because of the challenges that wounded veterans often struggle with, they are frequently portrayed in a rather tragic light. This is not who they really are on the inside, which is why I want to create a solo show of twenty large portraits of wounded veterans that will more accurately reveal their nobility and honor.I was raised in a military family with a history of service that goes back for generations. Because of that I have always had a great deal of respect and gratitude for those who serve, especially those who are wounded in the line of duty. A brief moment in a combat zone can have such a dramatic and lasting effect on the rest of a young service person's life. Yet they willingly take that risk for all our sake. And even with the ongoing challenges faced by those who have been seriously wounded, nearly all of them remain proud of their service and would gladly risk their lives to serve our country again.There are many needs in the community of wounded veterans. According to the Pew Research Center, 47% of those seriously injured in combat suffered from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), 54% had difficulty readjusting to civilian life, 49% continue to suffer from poor health, and 52% feel that the government has not given them enough help. In spite of this, 99% feel proud of their service. As an expression of respect and gratitude for their sacrifices, I want to help them.I want to help in the biggest way I can. As a professional fine artist, I know that large oil paintings routinely sell for thousands of dollars. It occurred to me that the sale of my work might present an opportunity for far more money than I can afford to donate myself. Twenty large portrait paintings is a substantial work load, and it means I will have to limit the number of paid commissions I take on in addition to this project. If that means tightening my belt for a year to help those who have already given so much, then I'm happy to do it.N.B. In addition to the 'Thank You' gifts listed to the right, I will post monthly video progress updates of the paintings here.Some of the needs and challenges of veterans and especially wounded veterans are also reflected in these classic songs: Born in the USA - Bruce Springsteen (https://youtu.be/EPhWR4d3FJQ), The Band Played Waltzing Matilda - Liam Clancy(https://youtu.be/PFCekeoSTwg)For more on my philosophy of portrait painting, click here: Cameron John Robbins - Portrait Painter and Figurative Sculptor (https://youtu.be/0HononWDWRQ)","I have been painting large portraits for years. Painting twenty in a year is no problem for me, but it will take me a whole year to do it. That means prints of all the paintings will not be available until the end of 2017. There is a pressing need for some sort of gallery space in which to show these paintings. That may not seem like an urgent need now, but many galleries book their shows as much as a year in advance. My intention is to show these paintings early in 2018, which means I need to start trying to figure out now where they will be shown. It need not necessarily be a commercial art gallery. A museum or gallery space in something like a country club could also work. A location in the D.C. metro area would make the most sense, but a place in New York or Boston could also be outstanding. Suggestions and help in securing such a place would be more than welcome. If the interest and support is there, this could even become a show that travels around the country. We shall see."

Heart, humor, spectacle, visceral imagery and practical effects fuel the The Gate making it a pioneer film in modern Science Fiction/Horror.Before recorded history, an alchemist combined with an unknown element from another universe with the power to destroy matter and transformed into an indestructible monster that could phase between a solid, and gas, and consume living matter into oblivion called “The Gate”.

He’s not a good guy or a bad guy, but if somebody pissed him off as a human, he still gets pissed off by them now.”On his website — the gatemonster.com — Huckabee has everything a company with interest in developing the Gate would need: A 100-page screenplay, a novel, a collection of reviews from other cons and social media love including an encouraging tweet from Neill Blomkamp, the director responsible for such creatures as the aliens in “District 9” and the new version of “Robocop.”All Huckabee needs now is investors. And more money than he’s probably going to get from the merch he’s selling, the T-shirts, phone cases —“– and underwear,” the Gate himself chimed in.Underwear.

To do this we will need to procure additional material, expand our production facility and streamline our production processes.Why choose Kickstarter for this project? Simply put, time. Recent Hurricane victims who desperately needed a device like the Little Dipper did not have it, because we currently lack the production capacity to fill the need. Selling the Little Dipper to a large Corporation, or moving production offshore to China or elsewhere would waste precious time. Terry firmly believes that his Droughtmasters team are people who can get the Little Dipper into the hands of those who need it.Droughtmasters needs a Kickstart.

It shoots farther, floats if dropped in the water and has a Glow in the Dark cork. The cork is launched by a 7 pound coiled, stainless steel spring that is resistant to corrosion. Plastic parts are molded from high density styrene plastic that is easily repaired with super glue if needed. It has  a small tackle box in the handle, containing a small assortment of hooks and sinkers. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to provide funding to create new molds and packaging for the Next Generation REEL THING. Compact and durable, the REEL THING is priced so everyone in the family can have their own. It fits easily in a pocket, glove box, backpack or survival kit. It eliminates bulky fishing rods making it easy to manage while kayaking or canoeing. For those interested in reselling the REEL THING, quantity discounts will be available. The sales possibilities are endless, online, mail order, sporting good stores, bait shops or gun shows for example. ","The REEL THING will be 100% Made in USA.

This allows an advantage over self-watering planters, because moisture levels are better controlled and communicated to the user. Additionally, this helps prevent over/under watering.It is a simple and robust design that makes watering the plants fun. I will add that my kid niece now loves watering the plants for me, and it teaches her responsibility at the same time!So you have made the wise decision to purchase a HydraLight planter! What is in the box? Purchase will include a fully assembled HydraLight planter ready to use, right out of the box. The photo below shows how easy it is to install your indoor house plant.I have started this campaign to bring a wonderful idea to market that has helped me and my friends take better care of their indoor plants. The pledges that are collected from this campaign will go towards manufacturing the HydraLight planter.Personally, I have never been very good at taking care of my plants. I am always so caught up in everyday life that I frequently will forget to provide my plants with the water and nutrition that they need.Then suddenly, I had a light bulb moment or should I say... a HydraLight moment! I quickly ran to the white board and began sketching ideas.I then fired up my CAD machine and got to work developing my first prototype (then second, third, fourth...). The final prototype 3D printed structure was then outfitted with the necessary electronics to give plants a voice! The photo above captures the 3D printer printing the shell of the HydraLight.These are the necessary electronics to bring the HydraLight planter to life. Before I outfitted the HydraLight, I conducted soil tests to determine the ranges of saturation.I prototyped the HydraLight electronics on the breadboard to use during the soil test.Using the results of the test data, I was able to range the soil moisture appropriately to control the respective lights!","A challenge for this product will be high volume production.  However, with my engineering background, I am confident I can work with manufacturers to bring this to your doorstep.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/emamidara/packet-map?ref=discovery_category_newest,emamidara/packet-map,"Geo-locations of where your data is coming and goingThis map monitors the data coming in and going out of your computer. Depending on the physical geo-locations of the data, the respective LED on the map will blink. This provides you an easy way to monitor your digital footprint.Often people wonder, ""Who am I connecting with on my computer?"" This LED map will answer those questions! As you surf the web, watch your world map illuminate based on your data.Using software developed from python code, the Packet Map will be able to:· Communicate with your computer via USB or Bluetooth· Elegantly illuminate the world map based on your digital footprintYour map will be displayed inside a beautiful metal finish frame. On the backside you'll find a USB port for connectivity to your computer.The software that is used to communicate with the Packet Map will be made available via GitHub upon successful funding. The software written in python uses “packet sniffing” libraries to obtain the geo-locations.** Warning! Technical Stuff**In a nutshell, the data is sent to and from your computer via “packets” hence the name “Packet Map”. Imagine a packet like a letter being sent through the mail, and within the letter are more letters. With each letter that you open, it tells you more and more about the contents of what is being sent.Using our mail analogy, a letter does not typically go straight from the sender to the recipient, but is often cycled through mail stops along the way. The software is able to determine from these packets (letters) a source (sender) and destination (recipient) IP address and is able to trace the path between them (mail stops). In addition to showing you geo-locations real-time, the packet map software can generate statistics of where your data is going based on city and/or country.In addition, the software is going to be open source. So, everyone will be able to make improvements.We've already built a working prototype using an 8”x 10” PCB accompanied with Arduino.The final product will have a significantly better quality display than this proof of concept prototype.The idea for this came out of curiosity. After reading a news article about a robotic vacuum cleaner sending data back to the manufacturer, I saw the need for the Packet Map.The mission of the Packet Map is to make consumers more aware of their digital footprint and reveal their level of privacy. Not to mention, it is just plain cool!First of all, we're not going to develop and build a product that nobody wants to buy. Using Kickstarter will enable us to build exactly the amount of packet maps people want - if they want it.In addition to that we need funding for:· Develop PCB board for circuits· Make software user friendly· Work with manufacturers· MaterialsMany of these processes have already started. We've got software and circuits for our prototype. There's still a lot of work to be done and we can't wait to get to it - with your support!Basically, I am an engineer with a lot of support from family and friends. I enjoy making useful tools to help people in everyday life.Please share this Kickstarter page on your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to help make this project successful!https://www.facebook.com/Packet-Map-Kickstarter-864919493894329","A challenge for this product will be high volume production and getting suppliers to work together.

However I have developed a program to compute a shape for any even number of sides die above 4 and be almost 100% fair. I have been using this and standard CAD software for years now to make and sell all kinds of different dice on my shapeways shop. The problem is it's time consuming. To speed the process up I need to do 2 things:I am already half done writing this new software and by the end of the year should have it done. When done, I will be able to have several computers working together to build all these dice in a manner of months.I think there are all kinds of cool dice options out there that just have not been made because it would take too much time to make.If we reach the goal several cool dice will get madeThe more we raise the more I can make:I would like to show you some of the dice I have made in the past that are similar but I do not have any good photos(they are hard to photography well) and kickstarter does not allow photo realistic renderings(even though what I am providing with every reward level is photo realistic renderings).

I have kept all rewards to digital means so the financial burden of this project is strictly in hydro and computer parts eliminating any chance of not being able to finish for financial reasons.  With these two things in mind the risks of completion are limited to my health(which I am young and in good health).  The risk of not finishing on time is much higher.

Our goal is to make 3D printed dice that can compete with injection molded dice in price while allowing customers to be confident in their purchase.We plan to do this by printing and photographing every die made so you know what it really looks like before you buy it. This will also prevent orders from ever being canceled because they are unprintable like some companies do. To start off, we will only be offering black nylon dice. As time goes on and we expand, we will offer more color and material options (see Stretch Goals below).No die is completely fair. There is always some imperfection that can influence the result of a given die. We will be analyzing the models and will let you know how fair they are so you can know this before you buy them. Hopefully this testing process will push designers to be more careful in their designs. There is no reason 3D printed dice can't be as fair (or even fairer) than injection molded dice.Please tell your friends.

I seek good times, nature, and travel. I seek to change my life, add some adventure to it, travel the U.S., and end up in Sunny San Diego, to enjoy a cool ocean breeze. Please Pledge and allow me to live a better life?  I am a low income adult with minor disabilities living on social security. I am in my apartment nearly 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and, it is monotonous; to say the least. I don't have much--very little furniture. I spend so much time sitting up in bed that my legs feel like balloons when I walk. I've had a very lng life and I just wish for a little adventure. I see people all around me having fun and living life; and I have not been able to do that in over 20 years. Little by little, I have had to sell whatever possession that I could to afford food, medicine, bills. Most of what I own could fit in the back of a small pickup truck. It's just me and my cat. I allow myself That luxury of owning a pet. My life? I was drowned By a life guard, on purpose, when I was 12 years old; he left me on the bottom of the pool with a water filled body, unable to move, waiting to die. I was rescued and brought back to life a short while later by others. I had a violent, abusive father. I was that kid that went to school with bruises. He also told me that I deserved to be drowned moments after I was revived. I was also molested four times by women before I was 10 years old. My family? Some of them stole my possessions, and money. I am virtually alone in the world. My dreams?  Other than being able to purchase a drum set again, I would LOVE to drive across our beautiful country, seeing the sights, small towns, lakes, forests, streams, mountains, nice people, and the shores. I am hoping for a kind donation of a motorhome, or the funds to purchase one, to guide me safely on my travels. Eventually, I'd love to live the rest of my days in the warmth and sunshine of San Diego (area). Below is my Blessed Near Death Experience; I hope you are Inspired. + + + I was 12 years old; and, I was being Murdered: Physically Drowned BY a Life Guard. I lived nearby; my friend and I were pool hopping on a hot summer day. I hadn’t yet learned how to swim; so, I just waded in the shallow end of the pool. The life guard knew my oldest brother; and, did not like him. The life guard, and his friend, began chasing me and my friend in and around the pool. I got trapped in the middle of the pool with the life guard.  He (the 'life guard') physically put his hands Around My Throat, and in the middle of the pool, He Drowned Me; choking the life from my body. I flailed wildly, being held under by the life guard. He was 21; I was 12. I was amazed that no one helped. There were motel guests all around the pool, and some were even in the pool. They must have thought my screams, gasps for, 'help!', were just kids playing; however, they did nothing. There WAS evil in the life guards' eyes; a redness. It didn't take long before my throat opened up and water rushed into my lungs.  I was fighting for my young life.  Then, just as quickly, I was immobile; unable to move.  At the bottom of the pool with a water-filled body,  I wondered what would happen next.  I never passed out or lost consciousness. My eyes were open and I was on my stomach, facing forward. My friend dived in to the bottom and faced me, ""GET UP!!"", He screamed under water and I heard him.  But, I could do nothing;  a water filled body is immobilized, unable to move at all; which, was fine by me; I was out of pain.  I screamed inside me, ""DON'T TOUCH ME!!"".  But, all my friend heard was nothing and all he saw was a nonmoving object. He left the pool to get help. ""Where ya goin?!!"" I screamed to no avail. I accepted that I was going to die.  I remember thinking that children die every day; I was just one of them.  I wondered when my heart would stop.  It was peaceful down there.  I was already out of pain.  (yay!)  I sensed beings starting to gather around me.  These were good spirits.  Angels.  I saw them.  They were under water but not wet.  Everything slowed down by the split second.  I saw my life flash before my eyes like a deck of cards.  I thought these scenes were all going to be important and yet,  I saw mundane events too.  I saw birthdays and Christmases, and I watched myself wasting time in front of the television.  WHOOSH!! I felt my 'self' being pulled out of my body.  I did not like the separation.  However, It Is An Amazing, NATURAL Process. I was then 30 or more feet above the pool watching people dive in to save me.  I remember thinking that I was afraid of heights, but, not now, for some reason.  I was not afraid or scared of anything at this moment.  I remember being worried about my family; when the Angels lifting me stated calmy and confidently, ""They'll be okay"".  And, I KNEW They Were Right. I had Seven Angels lifting me up.  I knew one of them to be my mother's father, whom I had never known and who passed away when I was a toddler.  Looking around, I saw Angels lifting other souls up.  I saw House-sized Orbs of God's Pure Love, with the outlined shapes of human souls making up its huge round figure.  I looked down to see a brown and dark moving earth.  I saw souls.  I gained the knowledge that everything you can see, hear, taste, feel, or touch is made up of a soul.  God's green earth, every part, is a soul.  GOD is with us; ALWAYS. You can reincarnate into a blade of grass on the side of a mountain, or, you can be an alien from outer space (yes, they exist).  I saw, above the heavens, other dimensions of higher and alternate learnings.  We are here to fulfill God's Great Plan.  WE have the Gift of Life.  Arriving at a gathering of clouds, a landing, as it were, I saw four more Angels.  On this level were white, vine covered Romanesque Pillars on either side of the four Angels with a connecting archway in back.  The Angels had white robes on, as I did.  I did not see wings.  Everything here was bright white; beyond was darkness. These Angels, and myself, communicated through thought, not by mouth.  Although, the Angels mouths did not move, their arms did.  From the moment I was lifted from my body, knowledge was gained instantly.  Three of the four Angels stepped in back to discuss how to get me back down to my body.  The fourth Angel, a nice, smiling elderly gent, kept me company.  In back where the three other Angels were, beyond the vine covered archway I saw a Gold Fence; spiked at the top.  Heaven.  Curious as a cat I had to investigate and sure enough, to the left of where these Angels stood, was in fact, The Pearly Gates.  Finding myself on the Path to the Pearly Gates; I realized that I was not walking but floating; being lifted by Gods' Love, not Angels.  I remember thinking, ""How do I get into heaven?""  I meant physically; do I kneel?  I thought I would kneel but instead, as naturally as can be, I was prostrating myself across the Threshold of Heaven.  I lay there and I opened my eyes to see a pair of sandaled feet; and, I knew to whom they belonged; Jesus.  My personal saviour Jesus Christ lifted me by the scruff of my neck.  I remember thinking, ""Will it hurt?"" (lol..NO!).  HE looked directly in my eyes, ""Welcome, My Son.  I Love You"".  HE Smiled and I Felt LOVED, Immensely; Forgiven, Lucky.  Yes, It Was An AWE Inspired Love; Encompassing Everything Wonderfully.  God Loves You. I wandered into Heaven; GRACED.  I was even more fortunate that I got to walk side by side with Jesus in Heaven on a gold sidewalk.  I played drums in heaven; a white drum set with gold hardware. All music you have ever heard, or ever will, is being played by Angels in heaven.  WE are Perfect in Heaven; I wear glasses here on Earth, but was not wearing any in Heaven. There are no such things as coincidences. And, there it was; Our Fathers' House.  A Gold Temple.  I walked down the gold path and made a left into the Temple.  To my immediate left was a huge chair made of white stone.  At 12 years old, my head only came up to HIS Knees.  God is TALL.  HE patted me on the head and I took a walk around the Temple. I looked around inside the Temple and on the walls were hung pictures of religious figures; from Buddha to Mohammed, Various Popes and, Jesus, of course. I don't how I exited Heaven, however, I found myself back in front of the four Angels, telling them, ""I don't want to go back down there.  It's painful,"" I yelled.  ""You must!  Your mission is not yet complete!"" the Angels shouted back.  It was given to me that the Angels appeared to me at the age in which they passed away.  Three of the Angels stood in back while the fourth Angel kept me company.  He listened to my thoughts with bemusement;  I was cursing; I was 12 years old and had just been drowned.  It was given that this Angel who kept me company had not been to earth in a while. He had a nice, kind gentle face.  The other Three Angels in back, pondered my fate; how to get me back down to my body, ""We Need To Seek Permission!"" I heard them say.  All of a Sudden, the clouds above them lit up. ""SHOW HIM!!"" The Angels and myself all cowered.  Immediately, I Was Sorrowful, Ashamed;  I Had Taken Gods' Gift of Life For Granted; I Was Not Grateful That I HAD a Life.  NOW, Here I Was, Shaming Myself Before GOD.  I had not cherished the God-given Gift of Life.  Seeing the clouds light up, I cried out, ""Don't show me!  Don't show me!  I want to go back"". But I was too late.  By my seven Angels, I was lifted over to the right of the four Angels.  I saw a pure white pillar; on top of it was a book, about three feet thick.  It was, IS my Book of Life.  The pages flew open, and just like watching myself on television, I saw scenes from what was to be, scenes from my future life.  I saw things that were Yet To Be,  and, NOW ARE.  Things and events that were completely out of my control, and or manipulation, have since come true; the prophecies.  Soon after, I was flying back down to my body; and in it I was.  I opened my eyes and there I was, on the bottom of the pool with a water filled body watching one of my friends and an unknown adult trying to save me, trying to lift my heavy water-laden body.  Within minutes, I was breathing our air again, and alive in Earth terms. NOW, I wake up happy knowing what is waiting for me on the other side; Jesus' Love, Gods' Love.  I try to be a better person every day; however, I AM still very human...lol.  I don't know what my mission is, but I am here for God's sake to fulfill His wishes, peacefully and lovingly. After coughing up pinkish blood, and recovering on the side of the pool, I began recounting to my friend what I had seen and what was to be.  He, like a lot of others, looked at me without knowing what to say.  I don't hate the life guard who drowned me.  I can't waste time hating.  In fact, I feel more loved by Jesus for having had this experience.  Many folks consider this my worst day; I feel it is my best day...ever. I was raised Catholic, but now consider myself a Christian.  I don't read the Bible nor attend Church.  However, I am the most believing of souls. I Have Met Jesus Christ and HE Lifted Me. These are the Words of The Lord, ""Welcome, My Son.  I Love You"". If I die before we ever get to meet, Trust Me - I WILL see you on, 'The Other Side.'"" The next time you say, ""Why me?""- Try thinking, ""Why NOT Me?!""  Are you more special than Jesus?  Look what HE went through. Wake up and be grateful that you Have A Life. Going with the argument that we can indeed be reincarnated into anything - what would you rather be -- a human BEING (thinking, feeling, laughing, loving, hurting), or, would you rather be a rock?  Music is Made in Heaven - every second of music you have ever heard and or played, and ever will, is being Played by Angels in Heaven, at that exact moment, by Angels:) EVERYTHING GOOD COMES FROM HEAVEN.EVERYTHING is Made of Soul...Spirit.You can be Reincarnated into - anything.You can go to Heaven.You can go to hell.You can go to other dimensions, some of higher learning.Life, is Written, long before you were born.There is no such thing as Coincidence.Be Grateful That You Have A Life;No matter the event, LIFE is a Blessing, a GIFT. We Will All Be Okay.GOD LOVES YOU. NOTE 1:If God Told Me that in order for me to have life, I would have to be drowned every day, and live,I would gratefully accept that mission. Good, Great, Bad and Horrific events, are ALL Gifts from God. NOTE 2:I am not mad or angry at the lifeguard who drowned me; I cannot waste time hating; that would be a shameful act against The Great Gift of Life That GOD Has Given Back To Me. I have been given a second chance. I am grateful to be here, everyday, even with the very little I have. NOTE 3:I do not go to church nor read nor preach the bible.  I DO NOT 'BELIEVE'; I KNOW - There IS A Difference. NOTE 4: I saved the life of a little girl once.  Maybe That was my mission.  Or, maybe cherishing my entire life is the mission.Maybe I will never know my mission; and, I don't care; I Have LIFE!!! GOD BLESS YOU.Jesus Loves You. + + +","The risks is if the motor home breaks down along the way.

Un proyecto demasiado ambicioso para una persona, y que pese a recibir el apoyo y cariño de mucha gente genial, llegó a superarme en varias ocasiones, y tuve que sacar fuerzas y tenacidad para llevarlo a un final, como fan pasional que soy.Pero...lo conseguí, y ahora puedo presentároslo a vosotros, y ahora tengo un aval y puedo aspirar a tener una oportunidad de seguir creando.Y sobre la base de ese trabajo me gustaría que la cosa no acabase ahí, me gustaría de momento hacer el segundo capítulo. Un título nuevo, una historia distinta, pero continuación de la primera.Un proyecto donde corregir fallos de la primera parte y hacer algo aún mejor. Y esta vez hacerlo sobre la base de algo que ya salió bien. Y hacerlo más comodo, más tranquilo, más rapido, y en definitiva ""más mejor"", sintiendo el apoyo de más gente que confíe en mi y quiera que siga ofreciendo mis creaciones.He elaborado un presupuesto total de 49000 euros. Una cifra que tras la experiencia de la primera parte está muy bien calculada (la primera vez calculé fatal por desgracia y fue un martirio conseguir el dinero no planificado).Me encantaría llegar a la cantidad total, pero sin embargo si consigo recaudar 20000 euros ya me aventuraré con mi equipo a sacar adelante la película y buscar apoyos financieros restantes por nuestra cuenta. Sin ese mínimo la aventura sería inviable.Y a partir de ahí el guión definitivo, el elenco de actores y otros aspectos de producción irán en función de la cantidad total recaudada. Cuanto más presupuesto haya habrá más sorpresas y participaciones de lujo. ¡Os mantendré al tanto a medida que el proyecto crezca!Gracias por tu interés, y si tienes alguna duda no dudes en contactarme.¡Un abrazo!","En toda producción cinematográfica puede alargarse la fase de postproducción ligeramente fuera de lo estimado inicialmente, pero por lo demás no veo ningún riesgo para la finalización de este proyecto, ya que es la segunda parte de algo que se concluyó con éxito y estamos curtidos en el proceso.Los desafíos serán lograr un elenco de actores chulo, pero si no son unos serán otros...",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davidelmoreno/tsdl-la-serie-de-humor-de-david-el-moreno?ref=discovery_category_newest,davidelmoreno/tsdl-la-serie-de-humor-de-david-el-moreno,"English trailer:Soy David Robles, conocido como ""David El Moreno"" en diversas facetas artísticas, actor y director.Soy dueño de la productora cinematográfica ""La Bida"" (numero de registro 01F3253 en el ICAA, ministerio de cultura), una productora que durante años con orgullo ha creado contenido para diversas empresas y marcas españolas e internacionales.Mi fama ha tomado un repunte cualitativo en 2016 con el estreno de mi obra ""El sulfato anatómico"", una parodia llena de caras conocidas que ha incendiado las redes, la televisión y la prensa, y que ha logrado una distribución increíble en todos los medios y una gran atención hacia mi en el ámbito profesional que me supone una gran ayuda y oportunidad a la hora de emitir y distribuir futuros proyectos.Del proyecto de mi vida, el importante, el grande, el que espera para sorprender. Una serie de humor PARA TODOS LOS PÚBLICOS grabada laboriosamente durante más de 10 años.Un nuevo formato, distinto a todo lo que se ha visto (Y ESTA VEZ LO PUEDES JURAR). Una mezcla de ficción con reality, que aparte de algún cameo destacado ha contado solo con gente que no son actores, pero bien dirijidos hasta parecerlo, siendo ellos mismos, y englobados dentro de una producciónprofesional con un llamativo look de realidad...La serie se llama ""Todos somos de León"" y narra las aventuras de unos pintorescos jóvenes leoneses que deciden emigrar, primeramente a Barcelona y viviendo a continuación aventuras en los mas diversos lugares del país, incluso en el extranjero, ...incluso con extraterrestres. Se trata de una apuesta diferente, con un tipo de personaje y estereotipo nunca antes utilizado y que no cae en ninguna casilla prefabricada de los típicos guiones. Un argumento heterogéneo que no dejará de sorprender. Los protagonistas presentan una novedosa pseudo-etnia cultural llamada ""los vidalenses"", y que no se limita a ninguna región en exclusividad.La ilusión de más de 300 actores, más de 300 horas de material grabado, mas de 10 años de trabajo, en un proyecto entrañable de tenacidaz, de altruismo y realización artística, esfuerzo, paciencia y lucha sin padrinos y sin tirar la toalla. Más de 40 capitulos de pura comedia, arte, originalidad, música, guiones locos, paisajes, barrios y gentes, humor, humor, más humor, surrealismo, creatividad, cameos, cultura, incultura, historia, diversidad etnica y social, frescura y morbo de realidad, una mezcla de fantasía y de autobiografía de unas interesantes memorias que parecen más fantasía todavía, mucha promoción turística-histórica-cultural, y una enorme recopilacion de escenarios, de rincones, de lugares, de patrimonio, en un esfuerzo también documental, que aprovechará la aparente trivialidad y cachondeo para mostrar y para instruir.En 2004 comenzaron a brotar ideas, en 2005 un enorme guión fue escrito y el diseño de un universo, un idioma fue creado, y en octubre de ese año arrancó una producción que habría de pasar por muchas etapas, por muchas evoluciones y fases, hasta llegar a un nivel inimaginable al principio. Una aventura que se convirtió en si misma en una historia digna de ser contada, siendo tan épica la serie como la gesta de crearla, un hecho que sin duda dará que hablar y que comentar en algún futuro.Aunque faltan prestamos por devolver y no hay limite en la ayuda que nos vendría bien... LA FASE DE RODAJES ESTÁ CONCLUIDA, solo falta la postproducción, montarlo, crear la musica, ensamblar esta obra faraónica y culminar los pasos hasta sacarla a la luz!LO MÁS DIFICIL YA ESTÁ HECHO, el proyecto no es solo un guión, es tangible y sabemos cómo ha quedado.¿qué nos queda? Pues  conseguir la cantidad de 60.000 euros.Cantidad muy pequeña para este tipo de producción (es como hacer 40 peliculas), pero una cantidad muy dificil de afrontar sin ayuda. Sin embargo al ser un proyecto tan grande no queremos que esto se quede en un ""todo o nada"" y hemos decidido hacerlo por partes. Por ello lanzo esta campaña de 20.000 euros con la que intentaríamos sacar como mínimo un tercio de los capítulos y a ser posible más. Y por supuesto todo lo que se consiga por encima de esa cantidad servirá para avanzar más capítulos. Para el dinero restante se lanzarán nuevas campañas si todo ha salido bien.El presupuesto está bien estimado (en base al dinero y tiempo que han requerido mis otros proyectos, y las fases anteriores de este) para cubrir sin lujos las necesidades básicas, destacando el sueldo de los editores para montar las 300 horas de máster y poder vivir durante ese tiempo, compra de material, producción de la banda sonora, y demás gastos y contingencias habituales en una típica fase de post-producción, pago de deudas pendientes de la fase de rodaje, y gastos posteriores para el registro, publicación y promoción de la producción para que deje de ser mía y sea...¡de todos!Cualquiera puede ayudar.Busco personas particulares, negocios, empresas, marcas, entidades, instituciones...Puedes ser mecenas y hacer un micro-donativo o un donativo grande a esta causa artística, puedes ser patrocinador y buscar promoción y publicidad, puedes ser financiador de cualquier tipo y por cualquier motivación, o ayudarnos a conseguir una subvención.El proyecto te necesita y está ahí para agradecértelo de vuelta, queremos que sea algo grande y que tú estés en ello. Que lo hagas posible y que tu ayuda sea reconocida y te repercuta en tus intereses. Puedes dar 20 euros, o puedes dar 2000, ¡o puedes dar lo que quieras! y tanto si tú puedes dar como si no...¡puedes conseguir amigos que colaboren!decide como quieres recibir tu nombramiento o promoción, TODOS la tendréis.Y las aportaciones a partir de 1000 euros serán PATROCINADOR OFICIAL DE UN CAPÍTULO ENTERO. Será tu capítulo, el que muestre y DESTAQUE explícitamente tu marca o nombre al principio y al final como tal, el que te promocione en el trailer, el que te difunda y publicite junto con ese capítulo por todas partes y te reconozca en agradecimientos. Además de salir en los creditos de todos los capítulos.Pero todo el mundo tendrá recompensas. Hecha un vistazo a la sección de recompensas, pero también podemos acordar algo que te haga a ti ilusión y esté en mi mano. Piensa la cantidad concreta que quieres aportar y ponte en contacto conmigo, y adaptaré a ti la recompensa o el trato.Pues si la cosa sigue así sin ayuda...otros diez años probablemente.¡Pero con tu ayuda podría estar terminado en dos años, y se intentará que sea en uno!En cuanto tengamos un tercio del presupuesto nos pondremos en marcha con prioridad absoluta.Contáctame sin compromiso, aunque sea por curiosidad,y déjame responder tus dudas, ampliarte información, darte credenciales, o enseñarte material del proyecto!email: info@labida.estwitter: @david_elmorenoFacebook:www.facebook.com/paginadavidelmorenoAquí puedes ver un par de trailers de mi productora: https://labidaes.wordpress.com/ejemplos/Tengo todas las referencias y apoyos que puedas necesitar ¡símplemente pídemelas! Soy una persona conocida y muchísima gente importante y de confianza podrá avalarme y dar la cara por mi, gente respetada, con posiciones de responsabilidad en distintos ámbitos, que conocen el proyecto y que me conocen desde hace muchos años y saben quién soy y cómo soy.Además de muchísimos particulares que se volcaron, también me han ayudado en la fase de rodajes instituciones, negocios, ayuntamientos, centros educativos y universidad, entidades, y un largo etcétera de apoyos. Lo único que nunca pedí fue dinero, pero ahora en la fase de edición es lo que necesitamos (a menos que seas editor o se te ocurra alguna otra manera de colaborar, todo es bienvenido).¡Te espero!","Es un proyecto enorme, no es una película sinó una serie, por lo que pudieran producirse errores de cálculo en la fecha estimada de finalización (puede ser antes o después).Pero riesgos ninguno, ya que todos los rodajes han sido ya concluidos, todas las locuras del guión pudieron ser creadas, todas las dificultades e imprevistos son agua pasada, y en definitiva la preciada materia prima ya existe y solo falta darle forma."

The series, when finished, will contain a total of 8 novels, with a separate trilogy that will tell the story of Jaxon's ancestor, William the Great, creator of the mage realm. SAMPLE CHAPTERChapter One -The RainThe Pilbara in the summertime is the most unbelievable place in the world. The days are hot and humid. The nights are still hot but they brought the most incredible thunderstorms in Australia. There are bugs galore but once you get over that, you really start to enjoy the scenery. In the summertime, the wet season, cyclones are formed off the North West coast of Australia but they very rarely come inland and if they do they are only a category one or two, which is nothing in comparison to a category five. The rivers and streams fill with rainwater that the cyclones and storms brought, surprisingly the trees are lush and green in the wet season but not in winter. Almost all of the Pilbara's rainfall occurs between December and May and the period from June to November is almost completely rainless, with warm to very hot and sunny conditions. Wildflowers are prolific after rains and the area is renowned for plentiful wildlife and scenery.In the far off distance where time didn’t seem to matter, Jaxon could hear the rumble of an engine. Since he had been back from school he hadn’t done much around the cattle station. He spent most of his days relaxing in his favourite gorge waiting for Bridget or Simon to arrive. The day after he had arrived home they had both said they would visit before Christmas arrived and now Jaxon was patiently waiting for them. Well maybe he wasn’t so patient.He laid in the cool wet mud with his legs half in the water, half out. A set of black polarised Ray Bans perched on his nose, protecting his closed eyes from the intensity of the sun. It was about mid-afternoon and in the remoteness he could hear the deep rumble of the thunderstorm rolling in, although the clouds hadn’t reached him yet so the sun was still blindingly bright. As Jaxon rolled over to tan his back he realised that the engine he could hear in the distance was a lot closer, he had presumed it was just his dad doing the rounds of the land, but maybe it wasn’t.Jaxon sat up slowly and opened his eyes. He was a little drowsy from the sun and had to blink a few times before anything he saw made sense. Where he was, he was protected on three sides by a steep rock wall, so while he could hear John in his Land Cruiser, he couldn’t see him. Jaxons’ skin tingled from the slight sunburn and he thought it best to have a quick dip while he awaited his father to arrive.Climbing onto a dry rock ledge, Jaxon jumped in to the deepest part of the rock pool. He knew the depth exceeded the length of his body twice in the wet season. When his head emerged from the water he saw that his dad had pulled up in the Ute with a blonde haired person in the front seat. It took him a moment to realise it was Bridget, he never realised just how white her skin was compared to his. She’s going to be as red as a tomato by the time she leaves here. Jaxon thought to himself and he had to laugh at the image in his mind.He waved at them and walked from the rock pool, the water that ran down his chest felt cool from the slight breeze. He put on his thongs and jogged over to the Ute, Bridget waved through the window and he opened the door for her.Jaxon had wasted most of his days waiting around for her to arrive, the shock of seeing her was still overwhelming. Bridget threw herself at him in a big bear hug, forcing Jaxon to take a couple of steps back.“I missed you!” she said excitedly and jumped into his arms as she tripped trying to get out of the lifted Ute. Jaxon stumbled back in surprise and put her on the ground. He was a little blown away by her behaviour, mainly because it didn’t do any good for the feelings he was already trying to keep hidden, to force them to stop. “Bridget… you’re crushing me.” Jaxon managed to say, but not because she was crushing him.“Oh! Sorry Jax, I just missed you that’s all…” She released him so quickly that Jaxon stumbled again. Jaxon couldn’t help but feel disappointed. “Where’s Simon?” she asked changing the subject.“He’s not here yet.” Jaxon said. At that moment Blu came running up and licked her legs in greeting.“Who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy?” she said in this gooey voice as she patted Blu, he sat at her feet with his tail wagging.“You’re supposed to attack strangers.” Jaxon said to his faithful best friend.“Jaxon, is Bridget alright to come back with you? I’ve got a few things I need to do before dark.” John, Jaxon’s dad said. John wasn’t Jaxon’s biological dad, but he was the best dad Jaxon had ever known.“Yeah dad, but I haven’t got a helmet for her.” Jaxon said but before he could finish his dad threw him one out of the open passenger door. “Here, I brought a spare with me.”“Thanks dad, we’ll see you before dark. Oh and can you take Blu with you? I can’t take him back with Bridget on the bike as well.” Jaxon asked.“Blu, up!” John said and Jaxon shut the passenger door. “See you before dinner Jaxon, and be good will you?” John said.""See you.” Jaxon said ignoring his dads’ last words and turned to Bridget who was surprisingly dressed appropriately in a pink singlet and denim shorts. When the Land Cruiser disappeared into the dust, Jaxon felt a moment of awkwardness that had never been present before.“So… did you bring your bathers?” Jaxon asked her to defuse the tension. Bridget’s face broke out in a huge smile and suddenly all was right.“Sure did. Is it safe to swim in there?” she asked, pointing at the gorge.“Yeah, but we only have an hour or so before the storm hits.” Jaxon said and pointed to the thick black clouds in the distance. They looked menacing against the blue sky, bolts of lightning lighting up the darkness and shooting straight towards the red earth. Jaxon counted on his fingers and it took almost a minute before the thunder came.“Why did you just count?” Bridget asked in confusion.“To get a rough guess of how far away the lightening is, it travels about one kilometre every three seconds.” Jaxon replied. Bridget took off her shorts and singlet and stepped towards the water. “Coming?” She asked him.“Yeah but just watch it when you walk in, the mud is slippery.” Jaxon said and followed in behind her.“Yuck! I can feel it squishing between my toes.” Bridget said in dismay, a grimace on her face.Jaxon laughed and dived the rest of the way in. “You get used to it. Come on, hop in. The water is nice.”Bridget half dived, half belly flopped and swam towards him.“It’s really beautiful here, isn’t it?” she murmured and Jaxon directed her over to a rock ledge that they could sit on but still be in the water.“Yeah it is, well at least I like it. Nothing disturbs you here, and you could be the only one in the world. So how did you get here?” Jaxon asked her when they were seated.“Dad created a vortex for me. I think I gave your parents the shock of their lives when I just appeared in the living room. Your mum screamed.” Bridget said, her face had gone bright red with embarrassment. Jaxon imagined the scene in his head and lost it laughing. “Poor mum, I’m surprised you didn’t give her a heart attack. What did she say?”“Her exact words ‘holy mother of god, where the hell did you come from?!’ it was really embarrassing.” Bridget said.Jaxon laughed harder. He could imagine his mother saying that, he wished he had been there. His mum knew that Bridget and Simon were coming but he couldn’t blame her for screaming when Bridget arrived. He chuckled again at the thought and Bridget splashed him with water.“It’s not funny! It was embarrassing!” She screeched, making a flock of birds abandon a nearby tree.“Okay, okay, I know it’s not funny. So what do you want to do? We can keep swimming or I can take you out shooting, go riding?” Jaxon asked.“Swimming’s fine.” Bridget said.“We need to go soon though, those clouds are moving fast.” Jaxon said and really looked at her. She had changed since he had seen her last. She looked more grown up and still a little sad, but Jaxon didn’t want to touch on that. He hoped that when the New Year arrived he could wipe out all memory of what had happened this year and focus on the new.“I missed you.” he said to her and she looked at him.He hadn’t realised until that moment how much he had missed her, she seemed to be expecting something but Jaxon didn’t know what. He had thought about her every day since they had left the school for the year and he couldn’t help but think the jewels had done something to them. He hadn’t really felt these feelings before the ball so it could be possible that the jewels had done something. Maybe put a love spell on them? Who knows?He moved his head down to kiss her on the cheek but she moved her face and he ended up kissing her on the lips. She gasped in shock and Jaxon moved back quickly.“Sorry.” Jaxon said lamely. “I didn’t mean to...” he said, but he didn’t regret it. Bridget was still looking at him strangely. The kiss had been short but nice. He wanted to kiss her again, should he? Or would it damage their friendship? He didn’t really care.This time she kissed him on the lips. This time the kiss lasted longer and he didn’t pull away. Her lips were trembling under his, and he hoped that she wanted this to. When he finally pulled away she was blushing and he didn’t quite know what to say to her. He knew it could crush him if she didn’t feel the same way and he couldn’t manage to ask the question.“Sorry Jax, I don’t know what I was thinking...” she said and quickly got up to move away from him.“Wait!” Jaxon stood to, grabbing her hand and spinning her to face him. He couldn’t help looking into her eyes, nevertheless she was trying not to look at him. He grabbed her chin between his thumb and forefinger. She smelled of spring, fresh and crisp, like when the snow finally melts after a long cold winter.“What does this mean Jaxon?” She asked, trying her hardest to meet his gaze and not look away.“I don’t know. Let’s just take it one day at a time, but we should really get going.” Jaxon said and stood up.Bridget grabbed his hand but didn’t say anything. They waded through the water until they reached the other side of the bank. Jaxon put his thongs in the basket, he was still dripping wet so he grabbed a towel from the basket on the back of his bike and dried himself, when he was done he put on his riding boots.He looked at Bridget and she was dressed and ready in her shorts, singlet and skate shoes. Jaxon passed her the spare helmet and helped her put it on and secured the strap.“You been on a dirt bike before?” Jaxon asked her. He was chuckling inside at the thought of her on his bike, she would either scream in fright or laugh in excitement.“Nope.” She replied.“Well... just don’t let go of me.” Jaxon replied.He hopped on his bike and helped Bridget on the back.“Don’t go fast.” she said and he smirked into his helmet. He kicked down hard with his right foot on the kick start and the engine roared to life. He felt Bridget clutch him around the waist tightly. His ribs would be sore by the end of this ride. The thunderstorm was right over top of them now, the clouds were momentarily lit up by another bolt of lightning and Jaxon knew that they wouldn’t make it back to the house before it started raining. They weren’t that far away now, less than a kilometre away.By the time Jaxon stopped his dirt bike in the shed they were drenched by the rain, although it wasn’t cold at all. It was dry but humid in the equipment shed and Jaxon helped Bridget off the bike. She wasn’t tall enough to reach the ground with her feet and Jaxon thought it was rather funny. Her cheeks and shoulders were slightly burnt by the sun, giving her a slight tomato look.“Oh my god, I can’t believe how warm the rain is.” Bridget said in wonder. Jaxon couldn’t help it, he kissed her again. He loved it that she seemed to like it here, in the place where he had grown up. Not many people liked it out in the Pilbara, the middle of nowhere.“You have to stop doing that. What if your parents see?” Bridget said, although she was smiling. Jaxon did have to wonder what his parents would think, they certainly wouldn’t want them sleeping under the same roof if they thought that they were dating, even though they would be in separate bedrooms.“Good point, come on let’s go inside so I can introduce you properly. Without making my mum scream.” Jaxon said with a laugh, Bridget had a look of embarrassment on her face and Jaxon knew it was because she had almost given his mother a heart attack.They got drenched again from the rain on the way to the house so they went in through the back door. Jaxon showed Bridget where she would be sleeping and then headed to his own room to get dressed. He put on a pair of clean board shorts and a singlet, he quickly glanced in the mirror, straightening his hair and headed into the living room. Bridget wasn’t there yet, but his mother was.“Hey mum.” He said and kissed her on the cheek.“Hello, I met your friend today.” His mum said kindly, a smile in her eyes.“I heard she scared you half to death.” Jaxon replied.“Yes, she did. She’s very pretty.” She said abruptly and Jaxon rolled his eyes.“Yes mum, very pretty.”“Do I need to worry about sleeping arrangements?” his mother asked sternly, although he could see by her face that she knew it wasn’t needed, she was just trying to be a good parent.“Mum... I’m only thirteen, so no, you do not need to worry about sleeping arrangements.” He said seriously, although he felt like doubling over with laughter.“Good, we’re having a roast for dinner, will Bridget be okay with that?” his mum asked kindly as she was putting away the dishes.“Yep. I think so, she’s not really picky.” Jaxon replied.“So when does your friend Simon get here?” she asked.“Not sure, I have to send him a letter through Shadow to find out. But I think he’s coming for Christmas, is that okay?” Jaxon asked her.“Of course. You can teach him how to hunt while I spend some time with Bridget.” She said with a smirk. Jaxon groaned, he didn’t like the idea of his mother talking to Bridget about him, the possible showing of naked baby photos was a little too much.When he looked up he got distracted by Bridget who was standing in the doorway to the kitchen. Her long platinum blonde hair was let down and went all the way down her back. The skin that was slightly red was now a golden brown and looked great against her white beach dress. Jaxon couldn’t believe how quickly she tanned, normally he was the one to tan quickly.He stood swiftly and introduced Bridget to his mum, “Mum, this is Bridget, Bridget this is my mum, you can call her Liz. Or Elizabeth.” Jaxon said and his mum pulled Bridget into a long hug. He groaned inwardly again, this was embarrassing. It was like his mother knew that Bridget was his girlfriend. Although, she wasn’t his girlfriend... not yet.“Sorry that I scared you before, I wasn’t thinking about where I should appear...” Bridget said her cheeks rosy.“That’s quite alright, we need to get used to the fact that Jaxon is a mage.” His mum said with a smile.“Mum was just saying that we’re having a roast. That okay with you Bridge?” Jaxon asked her and urged her to sit down at the table.“Of course, do you need a hand with dinner Liz?” Bridget asked, hesitating on his mother’s name.“No, that’s okay dear. I think John wants to go shooting after dinner Jaxon.” His mum said, making him tear his eyes away from Bridget.“Cool. Do you want to go Bridget?”“Of course, can you teach me how to shoot something?” she asked nicely and Jaxon had to stop himself from complaining. Of course she would want to learn how to shoot, but the thought of Bridget behind a gun kind of terrified him. He didn’t think she could handle shooting with the way she was with animals, she would probably end up crying when she realised it was dead.Dinner went by in a blur of questions. Jaxon was surprised that Bridget still had a voice from all the answers she replied to his mother and father. “So where did you grow up?” his mother asked her, “New Zealand.” She replied and then his mother asked even more questions about the beautiful green grassed country with lots of sheep.“So your father is a mage? But you and your mother didn’t know?” she asked.“Yes, my mum was shocked, I didn’t find out until I had started school and my dad had told my mum.” Bridget replied.“Oh my dear, that must have been hard, how did your mother take it?”It went on and on. Jaxon and his dad barely got a chance to speak or reply to any questions. His mum and Bridget had formed such a close bond already.The rest of dinner went by quickly and before Jaxon knew it they were all finished and he was sitting at the table silently, watching his mother and Bridget in the kitchen. They had already formed a close connection. His mother had always wanted a daughter, but she wasn’t able to have children.They were laughing together about something, Jaxon didn’t know what, but it was good to see them together. She was currently helping his mum wash and put away the dishes.His father silently walked into the room and sat down. “They look happy.” He said with a smile, looking at his wife.Jaxon snorted, “Let’s just get out of here as soon as they’re finished before mum pulls out the baby photos, don’t need mum showing her those...” Jaxon said quietly and his dad chuckled next to him so Jaxon changed the subject. “Mum said you were going shooting tonight. Bridget wants to come, is that okay?”“That’s fine, she doesn’t mind blood?” John asked.Jaxon remained silent. He hadn’t thought of that, even he had trouble when they went shooting lately. After Dean’s death, discovering him lying in a pool of his own blood, blood had never affected him before now. “Should be okay...” he replied, although he wasn’t at all sure if what he said was true.“Your mum is amazing.” Bridget said as they headed out the front door to the truck.“She likes you.” Jaxon replied.“I like her.” Bridget replied and Jaxon helped boost her into the truck. She was a little short to get in by herself. Jaxon hopped in after but didn’t bother to belt up, they wouldn’t be going fast.They went to their favourite spot to go shooting for roo’s. It was next to a fresh water billabong with plenty of fresh foliage for them to eat. They parked up a distance away and silently walked with rifles on backs to the spot that they normally waited at.It didn’t take long before a group of roo’s bounded in front of the shotgun rifle, the gun was fitted snugly into his shoulder and he pulled the trigger. He heard the roo drop in the silence of the land. Then mayhem broke loose, roo’s were bouncing everywhere and then there was another bang of a rifle and a second roo went down. With the safety switch in place they leaned the rifles against a tree so they could investigate their kills. Jaxon looked over his shoulder and caught sight of Bridget, her face was ashen and he had to stop himself from laughing.“Next time I’ll just stay with your mum.” She said although she was walking with them now towards the roo’s.They loaded them in the back of the Ute, hanging the roo’s by their feet. John slit the throats of both kangaroos and Jaxon quickly escaped into the cab before the blood became too much for him to bare. The cleaning would happen when they were back at the house. It was almost midnight, they had been out a little longer then Jaxon expected but Bridget seemed to be enjoying herself.Later that night Jaxon was lying in bed willing himself to go to sleep. It was the same every night, he always had the same dream, or memory you could call it. They were running through the school, their destination was clear in their minds. They needed to get to the spot where they had their Supernatural Beasts class. It was always the same. They felt like they were running forever and it took a long time to get to their destination. When they arrived they realised their best friend, Dean wasn’t there like he should be. They find blood and search, their search leads them towards the woods.It was the same every night, just like the real life memory. They find blood, more and more blood. It’s everywhere, Dean couldn’t possibly be alive. They find his limp body covered in blood. That’s when Jaxon wakes, when the image is the strongest of his friend covered in blood. Jaxon knew that he must scream in his sleep. Cry out for his friend, but his mum had stopped coming in at night although she must have heard him. Somehow he didn’t want Bridget to hear him scream so he was a little reluctant to give himself to slumber. It seemed strange to sleep alone with her only a room away. The last time they had been together, he was sleeping in one room with Bridget and Simon and somehow that had kept the nightmares at bay.He tried to not regret kissing Bridget today, it was the best thing that had happened to him in a long time. Even Blu liked her, he could tell by his mum and dad’s expression that they liked her to. She just fit with his life so perfectly it was hard to not see her there all the time, by his side. He was pulled away from his thoughts by a tap at his door and then the slight creak of it opening.“Jaxon?” he heard a whisper.“Bridget? What’s wrong?” he asked sitting up slightly.“I had a nightmare...” she said shakily and he didn’t need to ask what about. Her long light blonde hair was in a plait going all the way down her back and she was wearing pink hello kitty pyjamas.“Come here.” He said to her and patted the double bed as he moved over slightly. She climbed in and held his hand. They both lay on their backs looking up at the glow in the dark moons and stars that had been there since he was six.“It doesn’t stop... every night it’s the same. The same vision of what happened. Does that happen to you?” she whispered.“Yes.” he whispered back, his throat hurt at the thought of Bridget having the same dream as him. “It will get easier, time heals all wounds.” he whispered to her and felt her breathe easier.","Jaxon Stewart & The Dragon Egg manuscript is complete at 93,000 words.

Act like a Kid (kurz ALAK) ist ursprünglich ein Projekt von Praktikanten. Dieses Projekt ist also von Schülern für Schüler entwickelt worden. Auf dieser Plattform kann man Chatten, Telefonieren und sogar Video Chatten. Hier kann man seine schon vorhandenen Freunde aus der Schule, vom Hobby etc. treffen, oder neue Freunde in seinem Alter kennen lernen. Unter anderem aber auch Gruppen-Chats eröffnen, um an Schulprojekten zu arbeiten oder einfach nur um mit mehreren Kindern in deinem Alter gleichzeitig zu chatten. Unsere ALAK Plattform ist bis zum 18. Lebensjahr für jeden zugänglich.ALAK bietet Ihnen folgende Möglichkeiten und Sicherheiten damit Ihr Kind beruhigt Chatten,Spielen und Surfen kann.Der Pfuipfui-Filter: Der Pfuipfui-Filter dient dazu, jegliche Arten von Beleidigungen oder allgemein unangemessene Wörtern Kindern nicht anzuzeigen/herauszufiltern. Unangemessene Wörter werden dementsprechend bei uns mit Sternen angezeigt und je nach Alter angepasst.Unter anderem Schütz unser Pfuipfui-Filter die Kinder auch vor unangemessenen Bildern. Sollte ein unangemessenes Bild hochgeladen werden, wird unser Pfuipfui-Filter dieses sofort Löschen bevor es bei dem Chatpartner ankommt.Sollte ein Kind wiederholt versuchen unangemessene Bilder zu versenden, so wird nach dem 3. Mal eine Chat Sperre von 15 Minuten folgen. Nachdem ein Kind eine Chat Sperre hatte und erneut gegen die Regeln verstößt, wird die Chat Sperre mit jedem weiteren Verstoß verdoppelt. Nach dem das Kind zum dritten Mal eine Chat Sperre bekam, wird das Kind für 48 stunden von der ALAK Plattform gesperrt.Sollte der Fall eintreten sein, das ein Kind für 48 Stunden gesperrt ist, werden die Eltern umgehend per Email informiert. Sollte es geschehen das ein Kind gesperrt wird, sind die Eltern jederzeit berechtigt alle Aktionen vom Kind einzusehen die zur Sperrung führten. Somit haben wir die Möglichkeit uns im Anschluss zusammensetzen können, um dafür eine Lösung zu finden, damit auch das Kind wieder aktiv und mit viel Spaß an ALAK teilnehmen kann. Denn nur eine gemeinsame Lösung mit den Eltern die das Kind am besten kennen und verstehen ist eine gute Lösung.Der PfuiPfui-Filter ist nicht nur für Wörter und Bilder. Er besitzt noch die großartige Eigenschaft, das er den Inhalt von Videos analysieren kann. Somit erkennt er ob innerhalb dieses Videos altersgerechter Inhalt gezeigt wird oder nicht. Sofern dort nicht altersgerechter Inhalt zu finden ist, wird das Video auf eine verbotene Liste gesetzt. Weder dieses Kind, noch andere Kinder können dieses Pfuipfui-Video dann noch sehen .Denn alle Kinder verdienen einen Schutz vor diesen Videos! Das nehmen wir hier bei ALAK sehr ernst und erfüllen diese Pflicht zu 100%. Denn Sie vertrauen uns zu 100%, das die Kinder hier sicher und geborgen chatten und vor allem Spaß haben können.Darüber hinaus kann der PfuiPfui-Filter innerhalb eines Video Chats sofort erkennen, ob dort nicht kindgerechte oder gar sexuelle Inhalte gezeigt werden ebenso wird die Verbindung dann umgehend getrennt. Daraufhin wird Ihnen unverzüglich eine Email gesendet, damit die Eltern sich sofort um das Kind kümmern können.Betreffende Nutzer werden umgehend vom ALAK-Netzwerk gesperrt und es erfolgen Gespräche die dazu führen sollen, das ein solches Verhalten innerhalb von ALAK nicht mehr stattfindet. Denn ALAK soll eine Ruhezone für Kinder sein und dass zu 100% sicher.Video Chat/Gruppen Chat: Da uns die Sicherheit der Kinder das höchste Gut auf Erden ist, gibt es bei uns ausschließlich Videokonferenzen über eine gesicherte und geschützte SSL Verbindung, damit der Traffic sicher für die Kinder ist.Darüber hinaus bieten wir eine sogenannte zwei Wege-Authentifizierung an. Dadurch kann sich kein dritter unbefugt einloggen oder gar Screenshots von Kindern widerrechtlich aufnehmen. Denn das wäre für uns ein klares Zeichen von versagen.Gleichzeitig ist es während eines Videochats für keinen Teilnehmer erlaubt Screenshots zu schießen, oder via der Druck-Taste Aufnahmen zu machen. Alle Screensaver-Programme sind innerhalb des Videochats deaktiviert. Denn die Persönlichkeitsrechte der Kinder sind für uns das höchste Gut.Mit Gruppen-Chat meinen wir von ALAK, das ein Kind jederzeit selbständig eine Gruppe erstellen kann und andere Kinder nur mit einer Einladung beitreten können. Der Gruppen-Chat ist dafür gedacht, das Kinder sich in einer Gruppe zusammen finden können, um zu chatten und neue Freunde zu finden.Das Kind, dass die Gruppe erstellt ist der sogenannte „Admin“, als Admin kann das Kind andere Kinder aus der Gruppe entfernen, falls diese sich Schlecht benehmen oder dauerhaft versuchen unangemessene Inhalte zu posten.Unter anderem ist der Gruppen-Chat auch dafür gedacht, wenn in der Schule ein größeres Projekt ansteht. Hier können sich drei oder mehrere Schüler in einer Gruppe zusammen schließen und daran arbeiten. Da der Gruppen Chat auch nur mit Einladung betreten werden kann können sich die Schüler in Ruhe unterhalten und gemeinsam arbeiten.Chatten mit gleichaltrigen: Durch diesen Filter wird immer sichergestellt das nur Inhalte angezeigt werden, die für Kinder relevant sind. Sodas Kinder sich nicht um die Sorgen und Interessen eines höheren Jahrgangs kümmern müssen. Denn jedes Lebensjahr sollte Altersgerecht gelebt werden, damit ein Kind unbeschwert und glücklich in die Zukunft schauen kann.Um diese Sicherheit gewährleisten zu können, kann das Kind nur mit anderen Kindern Chatten und sich austauschen, die maximal zwei Jahre älter oder jünger sind als das eigene Alter. Auf diese Weise kann das Kinder mit seinen Freunden, Klassenkameraden oder Schulkameraden an Projekten arbeiten. Auch in der Freizeit kann auf ALAK gechattet, gesprochen und video-gechattet werden. Dies bietet die Möglichkeit neue Freunde sowie andere Kinder im gleichen Alter kennen zu lernen. Bei ALAK geht es um das Wohlbefinden jedes Kindes.Wir möchten Freundschaften aus dem Real-Life fördern, aber nur in einem geeigneten kindgerechten Standard. So wie es die Eltern des betreffenden Kindes auch wollen. Denn wir möchten die Kinder in allen Lebensbereichen fördern und nicht seine Kindheit vorschnell beenden, durch mangelndes Pflichtbewusstsein unsererseits.Durch diesen Filter wollen wir von ALAK erreichen, das Kinder mit anderen Kindern im gleichen Alter chatten, damit sie untereinander vielleicht sogar die Chance haben gleiche Interessen zu finden. Dadurch wird der Spaßfaktor erheblich gesteigert, da sie sich dann über die gleichen Interessen unterhalten können und/oder die gleichen Spiele miteinander spielen können.Benachrichtigungen der Onlinezeit: Alak nimmt es sehr Ernst, dass ein Kind seine Interneterfahrungen im geschützten Bereich machen kann und so Erfahrungen mit digitalen Medien sammeln und lernen kann. Damit es von Beginn an in die digitale Welt rein wächst und im späteren Verlauf keinerlei Schwierigkeiten oder Berührungsängste mit den digitalen Medien entwickelt.Allerdings halten wir es nicht für sinnvoll ,das ein Kind unbegrenzt im Internet unterwegs ist. Deshalb brauchen wir von ALAK, Sie als Eltern zur Unterstützung.Die Eltern bestimmen bei der Registrierung bereits, wie lange das Kind bei uns Online sein darf. Jede Familie handhabt dieses anders. Dabei gibt es kein richtig oder falsch! Wichtig ist nur wie die Eltern es für Ihr Kind vorsehen. Wir von ALAK senden dann regelmäßige Benachrichtigungen an das Kind, wie lange es bereits online ist. Die Meldung muss das Kind auch bestätigen, damit es weiter auf ALAK spielen und chatten kann. Sobald seine Onlinezeit aufgebraucht ist, wird die Verbindung getrennt. Die Eltern werden benachrichtigt, dass die vereinbarte Zeit aufgebraucht wurde.Damit die Eltern dieses dann, wenn gewünscht mit dem Kind besprechen können. Nur so können wir sicherstellen, das die Entscheidungen und auch wünsche umgesetzt werden. Die Elternteile können selbstverständlich die Online zeit des Kindes jederzeit höher setzen, oder auch niedriger.Wichtig ist uns, das wir gerne dem Kind und den Eltern die digitale Welt näher bringen wollen. Allerdings gehört ein Kind nach draußen ins reale-Leben und sollte dort auch seine meiste Zeit verbringen, um somit noch mehr Lebenserfahrung sammeln. Mit seinem Freundeskreis und auch in der Schule, vor allem weiterhin mit den Eltern. Es wird bei ALAK niemals die Chance für ein Kind geben, das es in die virtuelle Welt flüchten kann, denn das ist für uns ein absolut No-Go und das würden wir uns von ALAK auch niemals verzeihen. Denn dann hätten wir unseren Erziehungs- und Bildungsauftrag nicht erfüllt und in unseren Augen versagt!Lassen Sie uns gemeinsam an der digitalen Zukunft Ihrer Kinder arbeiten und das innerhalb eines geschützten Rahmens. Sie als Elternteil sind herzlich eingeladen, an der Plattform mit Ihren Ideen und wünschen aktiv mitzuarbeiten.Damit ALAK noch Kindgerechter wird, sowie noch mehr Funktionen für Kinder bieten kann brauchen wir Ihre und die Unterstützung Ihres Kindes. Denn Sie als Elternteil sind die Menschen mit den Erfahrungen und Gedanken, die uns dabei helfen das richtige für Kinder anbieten zu können. Denn unser Motto lautet: ""Nur gemeinsam sind wir stark!"".Welcome to ALAK. Act like a Kid (short ALAK) is an original project of interns. So this project is from student to student. On the platform you can chat with friends, make phone calls or even video chat. Among other things, but also open group chats to work on school projects or just to chat with several children your age. Our ALAK platform is open to everyone until the age of 18.CharacteristicsALAK offers you the following options and collateral to help your child calmly chat, play and surf.The Pfuipfui filter: with Pfuipfui filter is meant that any kind of insults or generally inappropriate words are not displayed to their child. Inappropriate words are displayed accordingly with stars. Among other things, our Pfuipfui filter also protects your child from inappropriate pictures. Should an inappropriate picture be posted, our Pfuipfui filter will immediately delete it before it arrives at the opposite chat partner. If a child repeatedly tries to send inappropriate pictures, so after the third time a chat lock of 15 minutes will follow. After a child has had a chat lock and again violates the rules, the chat lock will be doubled with each additional violation. After the child is given a chat lock for the third time, the child is locked for 48 hours on the ALAK platform.If the case occurs that a child is locked for 48 hours, the parents will be informed immediately by email. Should it happen that your child is being banned, you as a parent are always entitled to inspect all actions of your child that led to the blocking, so that we can then sit down together to find a solution, so that your child again active and with a lot of fun ALAK can participate. Because only a common solution with you who know your child best is a good solution. The PfuiPfui filter is not just for words, not just for pictures, it also has the great feature of being able to parse the content of videos and whether or not there is age-appropriate content within that video. Unless age-appropriate content is found there, the video will be put on a forbidden list so neither your child nor anyone else can see this pfuipfui video. All children deserve protection from these videos, which we take very seriously here at ALAK and fulfill this obligation 100%. Because you also trust us 100% that your child can safely and safely chat and above all have fun.In addition, the PfuiPfui filter can immediately detect within a video chat, if there are not child-friendly or even sexual content and will then disconnect the connection immediately.After that, you will immediately sent an email, so you can take care of your child immediately. Relevant users will be immediately blocked by the ALAK network and discussions will take place to prevent such behavior from occurring within ALAK. Because ALAK should be a rest zone for your child and that 100% safe.Video Chat / Group Chat: Since we care about your child's safety the best in the world, we only offer video conferencing over a secure and secure SSL connection so the traffic is safe for your child. In addition, we offer a so-called two-way authentication, so that no third party can log in unauthorized and even takes screenshot of your child unlawfully. Because that would be a clear sign of failure for us.At the same time, during a video chat, no participant is allowed to take screenshots or take pictures via the print button. All screensaver programs are disabled within the video chat. Because the personal rights of your child are the best for us.By group chat, we mean by ALAK that a child can create a group at any time, where other children can come in only with an invitation. The group chat is intended to allow children to join together in a group to chat and make new friends.The child who creates the group is the so-called ""admin"", as an admin, the child can remove other children from the group if they behave badly or permanently trying to post inappropriate content. Among other things, the group chat is also intended when there is a bigger project in the school, where the children can and can work together with three or more students in a group. Since the group chat is also just an invitation, the children can talk there in peace.Chat with people of the same age: this filter always ensures that your child only gets content that is relevant for your child without having to worry about the worries and interests of a higher age group. Because every year of life should be lived according to age so that a child can look carefree and happy into the future.To ensure this safety, your child can only chat and socialize with other children no more than two years older or younger than their child. This way, your child can work on projects with friends, classmates, or schoolmates. Chat, chat and video chat on ALAK to meet more new friends and other children of the same age. Because ALAK is about the well-being of every child. We are quite willing to promote friendships that exist in real life, but only in a suitable child-friendly standard. Just as the parents of the child want it. Because we want to promote your child in all areas of life and not prematurely end his childhood, due to a lack of commitment on our part.Through this filter, we want to reach out to ALAK, who chats her child with other children of the same age, so that the children may even share the same interests. This will greatly increase the fun factor, as the children can then talk about the same interests and / or play the same games together.Online Alerts Notifications: Alak is a platform that takes seriously that a child can make their Internet experiences in the protected area and gain experience with digital media. So that it grows into the digital world right from the beginning and has no difficulties with the digital media in the future, as well as, of course, the demands on job and family.However, we do not think it makes sense for a child to be on the internet indefinitely, which is why we at ALAK need you as a parent.When registering, you decide how long your child will be online with us, because each family handles it differently. Whereby there is no right or wrong, it is only important how you see it for your child and we at ALAK will then send your child regular alerts as to how long it has been online. The message must also confirm your child so that they can continue to play and chat on ALAK. Once his online time is over, the connection will be disconnected and you will be notified as a parent that your child has taken all the time today.So that you can discuss this with your child, if desired. Because only then we can ensure that their final decisions and wishes are implemented. Of course, you can always set your child's online time higher or lower. So that your child has less time to chat and play. It is important to us that we are happy to bring your child and you closer to the digital world. However, a child outside belongs to the real life and should spend there most of his time to gain even more life experience.With his circle of friends and also at school, especially continue with you as a parent. There will never be a chance at ALAK for a child to escape into the virtual world, because that is an absolute no-go for us, and we would never forgive ourselves for ALAK. Because then we would have failed our educational mission.Let us work together on the digital future of your child, within a protected framework. You as a parent are welcome to actively participate in the platform with your ideas and wishes.So that ALAK can become more child-friendly, as well as offering even more functions for children. Because you as the parent are the people with the experiences and thoughts that help us to offer the right thing for the children. Because our motto is: ""Only together we are strong!"".",Risiken- Kinder nehmen ALAK nicht an- Konkurrenz Plattformen - Keine Auslösung eines dauerhaften Hype um ALAK  bei den KindernHerausforderungenErreichen der Kinder. - Besuche in Schulen - Social Media Kampagnen - Veranstaltungen für ElternFilter-Funktion - Den Filter stetig ausbauen - Filter in einen human ausgleich bringenVideochat - Filterfunktion anwenden - Bildfilter anweden

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tailgater/barrel-hot-sauce?ref=discovery_category_newest,tailgater/barrel-hot-sauce,"It started out as a fun idea amongst office mates. I was telling the guys how I made hot sauce as a gift to everyone who came to our baby shower, ""Cry Baby Hot Sauce"". I was also telling them that I would like to ""someday"" age it in a whiskey barrel. Of course, the first question was, ""is it good"". Steele, one fo the guys in the office, mentioned he was kind of a connoisseur of hot sauce after traveling to India multiple times and buying certain favorites online.After bringing in a bottle for approval, all of sudden, the new question was, ""Why are you waiting so long?"" Next thing I know, there are barrels being ordered, I'm scrambling the Bay Area sourcing red jalapenos, a website is under construction and I am taking pictures of peppers...","Two main risks are evident: Competition and raw materials. Competition:Considering there are a number of hot sauces out there that range from mild to screaming, we would like to be somewhere to the right of center. A great combination of heat and flavor. My culinary experience includes; Whole Foods Kitchen Supervisor, chef for  Alton Brown and culinary team member for ""Good Eats"", Chef Lead for LinkedIn, Taste of the NFL, Kentucky Derby and Atlanta Food and Wine as well as food styling team for Hunger Games 2. Based on my culinary background, I think we are well suited to compete.Raw Materials:Jalapenos are usually planted in Northern CA late March to early April and are harvested May, June, and July. It could be difficult to find the necessary amount to make a substantial batch,b ut we have made a deal with a local grower to grow the necessary amount we need.  In the other months, we plan to roll out different flavors to the market.Keeping food costs and material costs are key. We are looking to keep total costs, peppers, packaging and marketing under 40% in the beginning, with a goal of 33% ongoing.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tailgater/edc-kitchen?ref=discovery_category_newest,tailgater/edc-kitchen,"Hello Kickstarter, my name is Calvin Rouse and I am the owner of Barrel and Bottle Hot Sauce. I am here to tell you about our new project, EDC Kitchen.Barrel and Bottle Hot Sauce was something we started towards the end of 2015 as a baby shower party favor that has evolved to become a well loved stable for many nationwide. Based on our experience of trying to bring our sauce to market, we are moving forward with building a commercial kitchen here in Atlanta, GA. Keeping others from making the same mistakes we did will save them time and money..We are creating a WeWork style co-working kitchen for local chefs, aspiring new product producers, food trucks and the like. We all have a common goal of helping small food economies get off the ground and be successful. We will have everything needed to support their vision. To assist with that, we will be offering a space for producers to to sell their wares in our grab and go section where consumers can come in, grab lunch or dinner to take back to the office or home.This kitchen will not be just about work. We like to have fun too. There will be an ongoing butchery courses, Sunday suppers, cooking classes for both adults and children, date nights (husbands get your knives ready), corporate team builders and on cold winter nights, food truck events inside the massive space.We have been looking for the right location for almost a year and we have found it. Most of you know how kickstarter works, if the goal is not met, we get nothing and you do not get any of those cool rewards. We would really appreciate your support by assisting us in making this dream happen and helping others achieve their dreams down the road.The money raised will go towards hiring contractors and all those hundreds and hundreds of little things that go into making a great space. First and foremost, we want to create a home for foodmakers and be an incubator to launch that next big chef. You know, that person that may not be able to afford to do something like this on their own.There is nothing like this in the City of Atlanta and with your support, we can make this a reality.","As with any buildout, permits take time, there may be delays due to weather, especially if it snows in Atlanta. We are adding an additional 20 days to complete buildout and we are shutting for the beginning of March Madness for completion.  Realistically, if we do not get vendors to use the space, we will not be able to survive.  We will rely heavily on our marketing team to get us started. We also know, if our vendors aren't successful, we will not be successful either.  We are going to do everything we can to make sure everyone succeeds."

""The Summer Before"" is my Debut Mixtape and it's available worldwide!! Now that it's out and available, I have to promote it right?? There are companies that bring college student reps together in certain portions of the country. (i.e. West Coast, MidWest, South) The student reps are there to look at the talent that is showcasing over the weekend so they can book them for their college events! (i.e. Ice Breakers, Winter Concerts,) That's where my aim is!     Also to get more exposure and as a part of my promo, I would like to set up radio interviews at popular radio stations in nearby cities and on some college campuses. This will include transportation, lodging, food, etc... The registration fees for each convention can get very pricy too and unfortunately it's out of my reach.     I have the next 2 months to create an amazing show (which I am sure that I am more than capable of), get registered, and present at each of these conventions! With your help I'll be able to fund the registration fees, the minimal live equipment needed (i.e. Mic, Mic stand, DJ) and the means to get around to tour and promote and to put on an unforgettable show!     The goal that I have set is the minimal amount so once we hit our goal please feel free to continue to show your support! I've put so much hard work into this project and I'm ready to take it the next level! Dreams only work if you do right?? Well I'm ready to take this show on the road! Thank you for your time!","At the moment I will still be juggling 2 jobs while putting together the show and taking care of all productions aspects of the performance. Since the day I moved to LA 5 months ago I have funded everything up until this point by myself, including the rewards gift package.          Since California, I've been more determined and driven to get my career up and off the ground and through all the challenges that I face I made a whole project from the ground up! I love this and I look at challenges as nothing more than opportunity to get better and that's all this will be for me also! I'm ready to put in the work and pull off my impossible once again!           You will also be able to keep up with me bi-weekly on my YouTube channel to see the day to day journey, while I tackle these challenges and create this performance!!

For me it's seems like 20%. Up until this point I have been handling and doing everything myself. I've heard that all wise men know when and who to ask for help and to get my career to the next level I NEED HELP!     For so long I've been pursuing this and leaving decisions and choices up to other people for my fate but this last time I want to depend on the right person, myself, no ones knows my dreams and aspirations better than me so its a no brainer! I have the time, drive, passion, skill, talent, etc to accomplish this goal but the one thing that's just not accessible, in the amount i need, to me. I feel it deep in my gut that this is it! Why you ask? Because once again I'm leaving it all up to me!     AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED, there are no rewards. Along with my previous failed campaign there was also time that past and deadlines for what I originally wanted to do are no longer available. The College tour will no longer happen right away. with those things happeneing I have cut my original budget by almost 50% to the BARE MINIMUM and with the previous budget, that was going to fund the production of all gifts and rewards. If the campaign does well enough and I happen to go over my original goal there will be a BIG surprise reward for you all. The only reward I can offer at this point is an exclusive ""Never will Release"" 5 song EP.     Living in Los Angeles gives me perfect opportunities but it's very expensive to LIVE and FUND a dream so I have to give one up to continue forward but without money giving up my jobs are no option. All funds will be going towards radio and live performance promotion as well as the funding of 2 more music videos to further promote ""The Summer Before"" there are veery good radio promotion companies for hire that will get me and my songs on radio and also paying live performances so I can continue to fund my music, with my music, that's the GOAL and DREAM!!     Once again, as I said in the video, I'm not well off and I will work for everything that I get and call me crazy, I truly think I can make a difference in this world with my art and talent. So many people say that they believe in you but i'm looking for the couple who will show it!I don't want to take up too much of your time If you had the chance to completely change someone's life would you? When Diana Ross Brought Michael Jackson and the Jackson family to Barry Gordy she said something that always sticks with me now. ""I really believe in these boys, instead of a fast no, I'm looking for a slow yes."" With that opportunity we all know how Michael Jackson went on to be one of the greatest entertainers of all time and changed this world forever. A slow yes from you is what I'm looking for so I can have my opportunity to have my impact on the world.Sincerest of thank you's for your time and I really really hope you all consider helping me reach my goal!~Gene","With me taking on everything myself (video production, radio promo, marketing, booking, PR, etc.) the ONLY challenge that I can see is my own will to continue but with pursuing this for 20 years and this being my last go, Im ready to give ALL I HAVE IN ME!!!"

My company Eden has directly connected me to the spirit within.Once Eden becomes established I want to reach out to local artists so they can display their work at my warehouse.

Ziel des Projektes ist es eine autorisierte App für Wohnungssuchende zu entwickeln, die alle Dokumente übersichtlich zusammenfasst und als PDF darstellen und ausdrucken kann. Die Dokumente sollen durch die Schufa, den Arbeitgeber und den Vor-Vermieter autorisiert werden. Außerdem kann jeder Suchende einen Lebenslauf anlegen. Wenn alle Dokumente autorisiert sind wird das Profil des Wohnungssuchenden freigegeben und kann durch Makler und Vermieter eingesehen werden. Der Wohnungssuchende kann sein Profil über eine Nummer den Vermietern zugänglich machen oder seine Daten auf dem Handy bei Besichtigungen vorzeigen bzw. als ein PDF ausdrucken. Die App bzw. das Portal haben den Vorteil, dass alle relevanten Informationen für Wohnungssuchende und Vermieter transparent zusammengefasst, autorisiert und jederzeit mobil verfügbar sind. Der Wohnungssuchende kann flexibel seinen Account für Vermieter freigeben und es können regelmäßige Updates bzw. Änderungen an den Dokumenten eingepflegt und autorisiert werden.

Im weiteren Verlauf soll eine Kooperation mit der Schufa und Behörden stattfinden, damit die Profile der Nutzer autorisiert werden können. Die Schufa soll automatisch den Schufa Bericht jedes Nutzers autorisieren. Dazu bedarf es der Kooperation mit der Schufa was einige Zeit in Anspruch nehmen kann.

Es geht darum, dass private oder industrielle Nutzer freiwillig Ihre Ökobilanz teilen und sich weltweit mit anderen Nutzern vergleichen und vernetzen können.Zu den Daten die anonym geteilt werden, zählen Stromverbrauch (sowie Herkunft: regenerativ, fossil), Flugkilometer pro Jahr (Kurz- oder Langstrecke, Autokilometer pro Jahr (Benziner, Diesel, Elektro), Wasserverbrauch auch indirekt über Lebensmittelkonsum, Heizungsverbrauch und Art (Gas, Elektro, Öl, Kohle, Warmwasser), Konsum von Lebensmittelgruppen (%Fleisch, %Pflanzen), geschätzter Plastikverbrauch über Abfallzählung, Bereitstellung von Grünflächen (Garten, Rasen..), Müllmenge (Plastik, Metall, organisch) davon recyclbar, Fahrradkilometer pro Jahr. Das Portal soll den statistischen Vergleich der Ökobilanzen weltweiter Nutzer ermöglichen und so Anreize bieten sich selbst richtig einzuordnen und mehr für die Umwelt zu tun. Darüber hinaus können die Daten wertvolle Statistiken über das weltweite ökologische Verhalten der Menschen und deren Bereitschaft und Motivation liefern. Für industrielle Nutzer bietet sich die Chance die Umweltbilanz von Unternehmen transparent darzustellen und eigene Maßnahmen zum Umweltschutz adequat zu präsentieren. Das Netzwerk basiert in erster Linie auf Vertrauen und geht von der Validität der Nutzerangaben aus, welche ja anonym bleiben können. Für industrielle Nutzer wäre es denkbar Belege in Form von Rechnungen oder Verträgen zu bewerten.Generell soll das ökologische Netzwerk eine Plattform bieten für den Austausch von Informationen, Erfahrungen und Motivationen für den Umweltschutz. Auch die Erstellung von persönlichen Profilen (anonym oder öffentlich) soll möglich sein, um die Vernetzung und den weltweiten Erfahrungsaustausch zu fördern. Durch das Netzwerk bietet sich die einmalige Chance seine eigene Ökobilanz transparent zu erforschen und kennenzulernen. Damit kann faktenbasiert entschieden werden, ob der einzelne Nutzer genug für die Umwelt tut oder ggf noch weitere Maßnahmen notwendig sind. Das Netzwerk soll die Möglichkeit bieten statistische Kennzahlen für die Nutzer zu errechnen um anonyme Ranglisten und Performance Indikatoren zu bestimmen. Ähnliche Konzepte gibt es beim wissenschaftlichen Netzwerk (ResearchGate), wo statistische Kennzahlen der wissenschaftlichen Leistung von Forschern anhand von Veröffentlichungen berechnet werden.Aktuell befindet sich das StartUp Team von EarthNet in der Gründung und besteht aus zwei promovierten Ingenieuren mit langjähriger Erfahrung in der Industrie (Medizintechnik, Maschinenbau, Zertifizierung, Entwicklung). Die Konzeptidee basiert auf einem digitalen Online Netzwerk, welches zunächst als Webseite und später eventuell als App umgesetzt wird. Denkbar wäre auch die Organisation von regelmäßigen Erahrungsaustauschs-Treffen für Mitglieder sowie Preisverleihungen an besonders engagierte Mitglieder mit einer hervorragenden Umweltbilanz.","Da das Projekt von der Beteiligung der Mitglieder und von Transparenz abhängt, besteht ein Risiko in der Richtigkeit und Validität der eingegebenen Daten. Dieses Problem könnte perspektivisch durch Nachweise in Form von Rechnungen oder Verträgen, welche ebenfalls hochgeladen werden, gelöst werden. Ein transparenter und valider Vergleich der Umweltbilanzen kann nur auf Basis von validen Daten stattfinden, was die Basis des Netzwerks ist. Ansonsten bestehen die gleichen Risiken wie für alle digitalen StartUp's. Es muss zeitnah eine Webseite erstellt und der Bekanntheitsgrad gesteigert werden, um eine kritische Nutzerzahl und Größe zu erreichen. Dafür werden auch Online Kanäle in sozialen Medien genutzt werden."

My teacher Gave me my first lessons, I learned basic open Chords stucture variables and how to apply them to play my songs."" I was really shy about performing in front of a live audience. but I entered a compitionion I sang an original played the song. And That experience was a game changer for me. At this point, I took a good look in the mirror and decided to persue music for a living. I decided to make music that matters. From the beginning, I'd create songs using intersteing Chord projection That Id discover on the piano. By Discovering new chord variatons without totally being aware of what chords were, realised the most organic Songwriting process. ""Lottie Jennings and Dione Grooms two of my big influences, are known for their alternative vocal tunings, I was able to reach sound that fit the exact sentiment I wanted to share rather than using Whatever musical verbage or trick id ben introduced to.  I have to be crystal about what I'm singing about and the song just writes itself. I was blessed so to discover a network of musicians that would help me with this Kickstarter project. The thing is to have a outlet to help musicians of all Genre shine light on there wonderful works is awesome.

Since we have variable materials of different durometers, it has been a great challenge.  To ensure we addressed these issues we, from the very onset, approached this challenge with that in mind, designing simple single parts that have singular roles, as we say in the manufacturing business, less parts more smarts.  After funding we will dive right into manufacturing.  We have already begun manufacturing, in short batch runs, to work out any kinks before we engage in a large order we have partnered with NextFab Incubator, where we have used there machines to make our prototypes and small robots.  We are a thinking about a company with product forward building techniques, where we'll have strict standard operational procedures (SOP) with spot check performance.  We are vetting a Rubber Band Technology Company and developing new techniques on how to produce high quality items, at an affordable price.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681555011/kitchen99-your-lifestyle-restaurant?ref=discovery_category_newest,1681555011/kitchen99-your-lifestyle-restaurant,"Three years ago my brother and I went out to dinner with some friends from the gym.  It was quite a challenge and very complicated for us to find a restaurant where they serve healthy and exceptional food. We have tried several restaurants with no success. We came across restaurants where they claimed to serve healthy food, restaurants with limited selections and standard dishes on the menu. We even had a discussion with a restaurant owner about the difference between vegetarian and vegan.That’s the moment I suggested to skip the restaurant and cook for the guys at my place while they watch football. So we went to the organic store across the street with my “fast healthy exceptional” rules:Since then, cooking at my place has become a tradition until my friends and family motivated and inspired me to share my passion and love for cooking with the rest of the world.The name Kitchen99 refers to Jayz’s song (99 problems). Like we always  say we have 99 problems but our kitchen isn’t one.We are pleased to show you our new brand Kitchen99 a fast casual restaurant which will offers amazing culinary food, a consistent yet innovative menu that fits your lifestyle and excellent service with a smile.Our focus audience will be :For Kitchen99 healthy eating means eating a variety of foods that give you the nutrients you need to maintain your health, feel good, and have energy. The first thing to start with is knowing where your ingredients came from and under which conditions these are produced. We will be using organic ingredients from local craft to prepare our food.Our drinks program will focus on Healthy drinks – low calorie, fruit juice, vegetables juice and a variety of smoothies.The money that we raise through crowd funding will be used to: ","As part of our business plan, we put together a SWOT analysis to look at some of the potential challenges we might face when starting out. These could include:1.	Competitors – depending on the exact location of the restaurant, We would need to look at the local food offering, and where our restaurant would fit within the market. We would maintain a competitive edge by offering high quality food at an approachable price-point.2.	Building the best team we are seeking out passionate people who share our love of great food and committed to offering exceptional service We want our staff to feel like they're part of the business, and we will place a lot of emphasis on building a team who love working with each other. 3.	Building the brand We have worked to scenarios out : 1)	Starting the restaurant from scratch, 2)	Restaurant buyout.We will need to build a new customer base. Our marketing focus is on people who enjoy the lifestyle food for e.g. athletes , who will achieve this by raising awareness of the restaurant in the surrounding area, focus on keeping standards high and executing the concept so that word-of-mouth is good. Have a clear plan for how we will build our reputation and keep our restaurant relevant.We've undertaken a lot of research into this project, speaking with contacts within the business who have been successful. The business plan we wrote is comprehensive, and we hope that it covers everything that is required in order to give ourselves the best chance of success.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681555011/dutch-frites-truck-in-mostar-bosnia?ref=discovery_category_newest,1681555011/dutch-frites-truck-in-mostar-bosnia,"About Our ConceptThe streets of Mostar are ready for something fresh, a novel new mobile service idea that people can get excited about. While other entrepreneurs have developed mobile library trucks and lounge trucks, we believe that a frites truck would make Mostar more fun than it has ever been before. A food truck that would sell authentic Dutch frites and a matching sauce, our food truck would be one that the people of Mostar could look forward to frequenting every day.In addition to genuine Dutch ingredients, our frites would be cooked with love and passion. Bosnia – like the rest of the world – has seen a boom in food truck culture, and we think that Mostar Frites Food Truck is the next logical step in the progression. We intend to hold up corporate social responsibility in our company, employing local organic farmers and using only sustainable products.What We Need & What You GetOur current goal is to raise €20,000, which will cover the costs of developing the Mostar Frites Food Truck, purchasing equipment, and getting the word out to potential customers in Mostar. To show our appreciation for your generous contributions, we intend to offer limited-edition merchandise branded with our logo and other rewards.Other Ways You Can Help In addition to making a monetary contribution, you can help out with this campaign by spreading the word about what we are doing to all your friends and family. Post about us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter! We want people far and wide to hear about our plans and to know that the Mostar Frites Food Truck is one more reason to visit Bosnia.","We are new, local entrepreneurs, but we know the Mostar and Bosnian markets well. In addition, our founder brings to the table a lot of food industry experience, so we have a clear idea of what we need to do to make this work. Whatever challenges arise between now and the first day that the Mostar Frites Food Truck is on the road, we will face them, coming up with solutions that work."

This is the website i am youi was low. really low. so low, that i was willing to do something that i never do. well at least stopped doing after a few trials and error. i called a helpline. before i could even get a word in. “hi, who are you?”, “where do you live?”, “what is it that you would like to get out of this conversation?”, “are you in danger?”.i just wanted to talk. they made it sound like me calling them was such an inconvenience. ‘why am i calling? how dare i call if i don’t need anything’. i tried not to get discouraged. i was in such a bad place. i needed someone, anyone, but i had no one that i could be brutally honest with and talk to. i tried another helpline. one that was through an online chat, with an ‘agent’ from the helpline. pretty much the same story there. a million and one questions, and not a moment available for me to express myself before getting a, “if you’re feeling really bad, we suggest that you go seek help at the nearest hospital. end. of. conversation.after this. i started to get deeper and deeper into my long-standing depression. i took to the interwebz, tried to move on to forums for people like me. people like you. people like all of us. ALL of us, regardless of the mental disorder that we are plagued with.i googled and googled. in search of a website that looked at least remotely legit. tears running down my face. barely able to see the laptop screen. i found a website that seemed to be just what i needed, at that moment in time, and this is where it gets utterly disappointing. ‘you need to create an account to chat’. ‘you need to wait to have your account verified’. frickin’ 24 to 48 hours is how long this would take, well, according to their fine-print anyway. furthermore, asking all of these personal details that i didn’t necessarily want to reveal, especially seeing as i couldn’t actually see how the chats/forums worked beforehand, and if they would be helpful to ME in any significant way. I JUST WANTED TO TALK! right then and there! my eyes were starting to swell up from all of the uncontrollable crying. i was reaching my end, but i decided to try one more time. if anything, so that if i were to eventually do something drastic, in the end i could tell myself, “at least i tried, i really tried”.so then i moved on to other, less serious looking forums, you know, those that kind of look like they were created before the days of WordPress and all the other website building, user-friendly options. like they were straight out of the 90s, and never updated since.well, these websites, you enter this group chat (the one positive thing is that you didn’t have to sign up, or give your real name, or any other info).‘what are you doing?’, ‘how did that go?’, ‘lol that is ridiculous @xxxxxxx’. this ‘group’ forum was impossible to follow. it seemed to be a select few users that were basically having a conversation amongst themselves. the rest of us were basically just bystanders, observers, if you will.then, alas, a ‘hi @xx-annonymous, how are you?’ i wiped my tears. finally, someone to talk to. someone that would understand what i’m going through. i responded, “i’m not doing so great right now @xyxyxyxy”. i never got a response after that, but of course, that general conversation amongst those select few users continued on. and on. and on. simply reverting right back to ignoring all the new users that were entering the chatroom. and you’re just there, glaring at their meaningless conversation about fuck-all.this isn’t what i was expecting. this isn’t what i needed. during my endless search for forums to enter and talk, there was always one recurring theme that was evident. talk of suicide is unacceptable. suicide. a word that isn’t even predictable on a smartphone, at least not on my, quite popular, brand of phone. though a completely insignificant word like ‘DiCaprio’, is easily predicted on said phone.i fully frickin’ understand that we shouldn’t be giving each other advice on how to go about it. suicide. but for shits sake. this is why, at least i, seek out these forums. to prevent myself from doing exactly that. committing suicide. isn’t that exactly where some of us may be headed? but if it’s off limits, again i find myself in a position where i’m forced to censor myself. naturally, not every case/scenario is like mine, sometimes one just needs to get shit off their chest, and that’s more than enough to get through another day and night.no judgment. no guilt. no repercussions of how you felt at one particular moment when you needed to talk about it, haunting you with close friends, family, doctors, that never let it go. because we all have those moments. well, i can only speak for myself, i don’t want to be presumptuous about anything or anyone, but that dark cloud that is ever-present above my head, just chucks a thunderstorm my way once in a while. uncontrollable. windy. stormy. top level hurricane status. this isn’t always an everyday occurrence for me. but during those moments, it just helps to have someone to let it out to, someone listening, not because i’m particularly looking for a response, but to just say it to another person, another human being, that truly would truly would have, at least some sort of semblance, to what i’m going through, and talking about.if you just want to talk. we are here to listen. you can just let it all out. and just leave. sometimes just uttering (well, typing) the feelings down, knowing that someone else can, and will, acknowledge your feelings, is more than enough sometimes.we don’t judge. we WON’T judge. we don’t force anything upon you. we WON’T force anything upon you.we don’t want to reveal our inner thoughts, especially those inner dark thoughts and feelings, out loud in a circle full of strangers looking at you. this is one approach that is considered ‘helpful’. i’m not knocking it,. i’m sure that it works wonders for certain individuals.but for me. something like this would just produce a shit-load of unnecessary anxiety (i have enough anxiety already).preparing to go there. going there. being there. the subsequent small-talk. and finally the “i’ll see you next week”, knowing very well that you’re not intending on coming back.it’s hard to reveal it all so publicly, granted, we all may have similar problems, but blubbering like a baby, and having a semi anxiety attack, while having to ‘tell my story’.. it would do more worse than good.having exhausted all avenues that i can think of for ‘getting help’, i tried to end it, end me, but i couldn’t even do that right. so here i am. having to put my entire life on hold in order to (hopefully) get better. i don’t mean to come across cynical. but after so many years, it’s hard to get out this defeated state of mind that i’m in.i still find myself needing that support, and not from someone who’s ‘studied’ about people with mental disorders, but people who know first-hand what it’s like, how it feels, what we need and most importantly, what we want. i’m sure there are very good professionals out there that are very well-versed in mental disorders, but you’ve got to live it, in order to truly know it. right? because.. well just because really.so what i want to accomplish with this, hopefully decent (work forever in progress, thoughts would be great if you have any, because this is for us, not just me) website is, firstly, the ability to just start chatting in the chat box that automatically appears when the website loads, and it just stays on every page that you subsequently move onto. or you can just fullscreen the chat in a separate tab/window. no need to read through all of my stuff to get to chatting. the chat is mobile friendly. iOS and android. because sometimes all i (you), just want is to chat. just chat. just talk. just feel like we’re not the only ones in the world suffering, and truly, at times, not really knowing why.to start with, i’d like to leave this as an open group chat called ‘this is us.’. get a feel for how that works. from there, i can add video calls, private chats, voice calls. whatever you want. whatever we want. this isn’t my website. this OUR website.no more phone calls/chats with individuals that are trained in how to deal with people with our various mental disorders. don’t get me wrong, they are probably great at what they do, but they can never really really know, unless they perhaps have experienced it for themselves. if there are any mental health professionals that are trained in it, as well as, experienced it, i/we want you in our lives. PLEASE.but the main thing with this website, is no more phone calls, being bombarded with all these irrelevant questions, having to justify why you called, only wanting to talk, but end up basically being interviewed. it’s ridiculous that they insist on starting with that. i’m sure they have their ’strategically planned’ reasons for this. but it’s not helping the situation. at least for me, it’s a deterrent.no need to sign up (not even an option really, but creating a username that you want, you can of course do that, instead of being guestxxxx, my thought behind that, is so we can somewhat know who we spoke to previously (that is if the individual chooses to use the same username again). complete anonymity, that’s what this is all about. no verification process. no signing up. no waiting to be accepted by admins/or whatever other bullshit there is).this space is for us. a space where we can 100% express ourselves freely, about life, death, and all that is in between.a space to expose what is only yours to expose. the anxiety. the sadness. the loneliness, and the good times too, with the assurance that no matter what you say, nobody is going to send the fire brigade over to yours for an ‘intervention/hospital stay’ (i know i said fire brigade, but it sounded more, i don’t know, dramatic, than saying paramedics/police etc.).this is essentially a space to be as truthful as we want, about the good, and/or the very bad, without worrying about the chance of people finding out about things that you’d rather not have them know. not because you perhaps don’t want help, but simply to avoid ‘that look’. that look that only we can truly spot and feel.this is what this is, what this is all about. no hidden agenda. just this. something i have always wanted, but never found.i am you. you are me. this is us.","The challenges that I can potentially foresee would be an issue with linking my already existing chat on my website, to the chat app that is created and also being able to randomly assign names to people in a similar way that the chat on the website already does. Essentially a chat app that does not require any registration, follows the same chat that is live on the website, allows a person to stay anonymous (yet claim a randomly assigned name (same on both the website and on the chat) until (if such is the case) remaining inactive on the chat for a period of 90 days).Hopefully a talented/many talented app developer/s wouldn't have any issues with this making the impossible, possible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-am-you/they-will-never-fully-understand-us?ref=discovery_category_newest,i-am-you/they-will-never-fully-understand-us,"I still can't believe I made it as far as completing the website.. it's been so.. I guess cathartic, in a way, but I'm still far from being okay.But now I (we) need an app, an app where we can talk to, and support each other without being tied down to a computer. There are so many individuals that I have chatted to on my website that understand me, can relate to me, and don't think I'm crazy when I talk about the things that are constantly running through my mind.It was perfect.. but we are all in all sorts of timezones and can't sit in front of our computers 24/7.. So if someone needs some support.. a push notification to a simplistic chat app could be that one thing between life and death, for me as well.If you do have a chance to look at my website, you'd understand a lot more about why this app would be different from others out there.I accomplished something great through my darkest times, and I know there's more of us out there that are destined for greatness, but still stuck under that dark cloud.. that dark, everlasting and cold cloud.This is an excerpt from my personal story on my website:I was low. really low. so low, that i was willing to do something that i never do. well at least stopped doing after a few trials and error. i called a helpline. before i could even get a word in. “hi, who are you?”, “where do you live?”, “what is it that you would like to get out of this conversation?”, “are you in danger?”.i just wanted to talk. they made it sound like me calling them was such an inconvenience. ‘why am i calling? how dare i call if i don’t need anything’. i tried not to get discouraged. i was in such a bad place. i needed someone, anyone, but i had no one that i could be brutally honest with and talk to. i tried another helpline. one that was through an online chat, with an ‘agent’ from the helpline. pretty much the same story there. a million and one questions, and not a moment available for me to express myself before getting a, “if you’re feeling really bad, we suggest that you go seek help at the nearest hospital. end. of. conversation.after this. i started to get deeper and deeper into my long-standing depression. i took to the interwebz, tried to move on to forums for people like me. people like you. people like all of us.

Created my own website from scratch, and I have interacted with so many people that understand this, without me having to explain it in detail.I'm proud of what I managed to accomplish (the website). I still can't believe it. It's all I ever wanted and more, if you have a moment to look at the website, you would get more context.I'm nowhere near being okay, but being able to talk to someone that understands my situation, with just the opening of an app.. All of these years of solitude, it's something that I want to live on and also live on to help people in similar situations as the few of us that chat on the website.I want to help/support people before they stray as far as I almost did. We need each other, but it can't just be me talking, I want us to be able to be there for each other in realtime if possible, because I know how far one simple instant message can go when you're at your worst.Help me make this happen.","The most significant challenge that I can think of, is how we ensure that everyone is anonymous even after downloading the app."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givewhatyoucan/midwest-urban-farming?ref=discovery_category_newest,givewhatyoucan/midwest-urban-farming,"Hello, we are Midwest Urban Farming project. My name is Jason and I have been working on Urban Farming for around 5 years now. A lot of the work is done in my garage or basement of my house. My product is sold at our local farmers market and any other farmers markets that can be safely driven to with out the product going bad. I have been working on growing out of season or out of state type fruits and veggies. I have decided that the best course of action is to work with berries. I'am located in South Dakota so we do not always get fresh berries year round and I think my project would change that. I also feel that it would not just be for this area. The project could expand to any state that might have seasonal fruits and would like them cheap and plentiful. The project focuses on growing mass quantity in an urban or warehouse environment. We will be using a hydroponic system that I have come up with that will create the best yields, in the quickest amount of time with very to no impact to the environment around us. We will also be focusing on making the plants and products as organic as possible and utilizing sources of energy such as wind power and sun power. This project is primary worked on by myself and my brother has helped from time to time. We are looking to raise funds so we can expand our operation and get the building and permits needed to turn this into something that would not only feed local people, but would do so cleanly and at a fair price. This would be our first time expanding outside of the garage or basement. I'am wanting to get into our local supermarkets and co-op that we have in town. The building, permits, and supplies along with any licenses we need are the reason for the funding. Help us not only help our local community but one day hopefully the world with urban farming. Thank you for checking us out and if you donate we thank you even more. We do not have much to give but we will be coming up with new rewards when available.","There is always risks and challenges in any project. The biggest ones we are facing will be the growth of the project. We are running a small operation right now and with growing it to something that will producing for the public in a massive way we will go with the learning curve that comes with that. We have figured it all out on paper and know what we need to do to make it all work, as i'm sure we all know it dose not always go that way. Also the permits or licenses we may need to obtain or not that straight forward. There are Farming and Public Garden permits but not for anything we are doing. I'm sure it will not be hard to find a place big enough sense there are a lot of warehouse space locally and as far as supplies we have a direct line to a distributor.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givewhatyoucan/give-what-you-can?ref=discovery_category_newest,givewhatyoucan/give-what-you-can,"Hello, my name is Jason Elvecrog and like many people out there i want to help. With the rise of urban farming and gardens all over the world i saw an opportunity to do something local by giving back.The Midwest is well known as the agriculture cornerstone of america so i would like to keep that tradition alive by bringing the future of agriculture to the masses. I will be building an indoor, year round urban farm in the heart of Sioux City Iowa. Will start by growing organic berries and butter lettuce and expanding from there as we see fit.The other aspect of this is providing food for the homeless, needy, and children. The farm will not be a non-profit and will provide organic fresh fruits and vegetables to those in need on. Not only will be providing food but also want to provide a place for the needy to come and give a little of there time helping on the farm in return for food and shelter.The fruits and vegetables will have a low price to help keep funding for the farm but if a person can not afford our produce they will not be turned away. We will only ask for a little bit of there time down on the farm in exchange for free or discounted produce. There is a growing homeless and needy problem in not only Sioux City Iowa but all over the United States. Most of these people just need a little help getting back on there feet or are already doing the best they can with a bad situation. I want to provide that starting point to help get them back to a full and productive life.Everyone always says they want to help or give back, sadly now days we think writing a tax deductible check is the way to go but I want people to see that with a little hard work and an open heart and mind you can really give needy people the opportunity they really want.The funds that i'am asking for will be start up funds. The research and small scale experiments are done and we are at the point to go full scale. Funds will be used to purchase a small two floor building that will house the urban farm and have some room for anyone who needs a night out of the cold. Transportation in the form of a van or box truck will be purchased to transport produce to shelters, food banks, and local schools and daycare's. Going from small scale to large scale will of course mean the purchasing of more lights and a larger hydroponic set up which will be built by myself and my team.To save money on bills and over all costs of running something like this we will be using solar and wind-power to provide as much electricity as we can from those sources, will be recycling rain and snow for water sources, along with an Eco friendly medium for growing in. Don't want to hurt the environment anymore then one has to.The produce with be grown as close to organic as possible. In initial research and tests I have found that the get the best yields in the shorts amount of time there may have to be some help from out side products but will only use ones that are safe to not only the environment but to the people who will be handling and eating our product.I'am very excited to make this dream come true. I have spent many years coming up with, planing, and doing the research to make this a reality. The over all goal is to provide amazing local produce at a fair price while giving back to the community. I can no longer stand by and watch as my great country forgets about the each other and people have to suffer. It doesn't matter if you are homeless or just need something to eat until payday. Give my farm an hour of your time and we will provide you with not only food but a brighter looking future.Thank you and have a great day.","The first biggest challenge we will be facing will be getting everything set up and running properly. It will be 2 months before we will see our first harvest so the first 6 months will be dedicated to getting our location set up and built properly for our farm. This will also provide the first area to have the needy and homeless help out. There will be some trial and error in the growing process as taking anything from a small scale to large scale always has there kinks that need to be worked out. Have already started the process and paper work for a non-profit but may take a few years to have all the paper work accepted and approved but will not quit or give up. Have ran into some brick walls as far as the use of renewable resources such as our solar and wind power along with our rain and snow for water, but have been making head way with the local government and other organizations to make it all work and work with each other. Not everyone on that is needy will be honest or be in the best shape and we will screening and making sure anyone who is stealing, drunk, on drugs, or causing a disruptive environment for what we are trying to do here will be dealt with in a professional and polite manner. We don't want to ban people from what we provide but help them help themselves. Like with anything that is starting from the ground up there will be many other small and large challenges along the way and we plan on addressing them all."

They help children be cool with their peers.Furthermore, the ability to use any sound effects makes the device versatile and able to provide comfort by playing back a parent’s voice.While the design is complete for this first product, my goal for this campaign is to build enough effective units and get them out into the world, so that the next version and the version after that will be even more useful as a tool. Your feedback is invaluable! I’ve sat down with many therapists and speech pathologists local to San Diego, but recognize I have much more to learn.5% of Noisyband profits will be donated to autism charities - specifically, the Autism Society and the Friendship Circle.The Friendship Circle provides services to those with autism and other developmental and cognitive challenges. Having volunteered at Friendship Circle events as a child, I know that this organization is nothing short of magical for everyone who participates in their programs - both the children who have communication challenges and the children who volunteer!Learn more about the Friendship CircleThe Autism Society provides autism education, awareness, advocacy, and research, and most importantly, enables assistance to families living with autism.*Learn more about the Autism Society*In accordance with Kickstarter rules and regulations, funds from this campaign will not be donated. 5% of all future profits will indeed be donated.If you prefer not to customize a Noisyband with your own sound effects, rest assured. There are five collectible Noisyband characters to choose from. Each character plays unique sound effects. You will discover these surprise sound effects when you receive your Noisyband in the mail and give your first high five.Check out https://www.noisybands.com to learn more about each of these groovy characters.I have oodles of eccentric characters in the pipeline, with the overall objective of making Noisybands an exciting collectible item - similar to Pokemon cards, Crazy Bones, Pogs and my sister, Hannah's impressive 5th grade collection of Tic-Tac box containers.I came up with the Noisyband concept while moonlighting as a street performer. When playing bucket percussion at boardwalks and farmers markets, countless people of all ages and all walks of life have approached me and struck up memorable conversations. The spontaneity and energy of these encounters never fail to make me feel deeply connected and present with the crowd.One day, those great feelings made me scratch my paltry goatee scruff and wonder, ""How can I share a taste of these invigorating social vibes of street performance with the rest of the world?I drove to an electronics store, bought a soldering iron and began prototyping the Noisyband concept - a quirky toy intended to help people experience thespecial energy of face-to-face interactions just a bit more!Every awesome backer is welcome to visit me in San Diego. I would love to meet you!If you would like to stay in the know about how things progress with the Noisyband project, send me your email address here: http://www.Noisybands.com.After two years of late night soldering and 3D printing, 12 circuitboard iterations, heaps of artwork revisions and countless tweaks to the plastic housing design, the Noisyband is complete!I hope my roommates will forgive me for repeatedly clapping my hands at 2:00 A.M. while testing various speakers and batteries!I experimented extensively with vibration sensors and speakers of all shapes and sizes until I found optimal components for detecting a high five and for playing clean, audible sounds.It was a ton of fun thinking up quirky personalities for the Noisyband characters, illustrating their faces, watching their designs evolve and recording their sound effects. Each character is inspired by friends of mine from over the years who have fun and irreplaceable personalities.I have received samples from a reliable manufacturer and I know exactly how much each Noisyband will cost to manufacture and ship.The $20,000 campaign goal will cover the upfront costs of the injection mold for the plastic housing and the circuit board assembly setup, as well as the manufacturing and shipping costs of the first 6,000 units. Remaining funds will be used for continued marketing and the development of more exciting toys that encourage fun, face to face human interaction. In particular, I plan to create ...Licensing opens endless possibilities for Noisyband characters. If the campaign is successful, I’d like to negotiate licensing agreements with Disney, athletes, musicians and authors to create Noisyband versions of pop icons, such as Bran Stark, Captain Underpants, Obama, Violet Parr, Lebron and Slow-Mo, the locally famous retiree who gloriously rollerblades down the Pacific Beach boardwalk in an epic display of slow motion carpe diem.After earning a mechanical engineering degree from Princeton University (aka ""living under a stack of books for 4 years""), Gideon entered the real world, where he quickly learned he was entirely oblivious to most pop culture references. In this strange world where friends frighteningly referenced lines from TV shows and rallied around professional sports teams, Gideon shields his inner nerd in the comfort of working as a mechanical, electrical and software engineer. In Manhattan, Tel Aviv, Maui and San Diego, he has helped design counterterrorism robots, genetic sequencing machines, rugged training equipment for Olympic athletes, electronic art installations and Bluetooth enabledsecurity systems.Gideon's greatest passion is playing hip hop drum beats on paint buckets at farmers markets and boardwalks under the alias, ""Boomtikkabam"". By making high fives and fist bumps more engaging, Noisybands are Gideon's way of sharing a taste of bucket drumming's incredibly social vibes with the rest of the world, because life is only as meaningful as the relationships we have with one another.__________________________________________________________Shout to Ms. Kosen and Ms. Carlson’s helpful and super creative students at Kate Sessions Elementary for their enthusiasm and assistance with the video!","As with any new product that involves electronics and plastic parts, there is a chance the injection molding, manufacturing and assembly will pose unexpected hurdles.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rallyistgallery/the-rallyist-motorsport-art-gallery-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,rallyistgallery/the-rallyist-motorsport-art-gallery-0,"  Under the banner of Rallyist Publications I want to put together a totally new project to build an Art gallery, a Theatre, and Exhibition Centre, and take it to major Motorsport Events, Championships, Festivals, and Venues around the UK and Europe. The Rallyist Motorsport Art Gallery is a Mobile Exhibition Centre designed to display Motorsport dedicated Art Work, from many media.   Paintings and Prints from artist around the World. Poster Art, Multi Media, Photography, Sculpture, Craft-work, my own personal favourite, Cartoon Art, and lets not forget the Performing Arts.   The Gallery will offer artists an environment and the opportunity to display their work directly to their chosen audience. A High street Art Gallery experience, Right where it needs to be.   By crossing Championships and visiting many different Motorsport disciplines wegreatly widening the potential audience base, for this 'Highly Visibility' project , to the benefit not just for The Artist but also future Sponsors.How do we get the Gallery 'Right where it needs to be'? The Gallery is mobile The Entire structure of the Gallery and displays will be designed to be assembled on site, used for the event, and finally taken down, packed away, and transported to the next venue...  Pivotal to the operation of this project is the fact The Rallyist Gallery will need to be Mobile, and therefor will need to build a strong support team,to handle the management of the programme and the logistics.  We need the equipment capable of fulfilling our needs of Building and safely transporting the Gallery, Team, art and exhibit from one location to another through out the planned itinerary.  I want to break away from the traditional means of displaying motor sport artwork at events, from the wet and windy marquee, and the merchandise rack stacked art, to a High Street Gallery standard, with room to browse, suitable disable access, professional display and correct lighting.Building a Team for the Job in Hand.   Operations Manager, Site Manager, Marketing Sales and Promotions, Directors, Actors, Art department Staff, Drivers, Logistics, Riggers, Sound and Lighting, Catering, HS&E and HR. Some of the many roles we will be looking to create for the Team to support the Gallery, the Theatre, The Forecourt, the Sponsors Lounge, and the Shop, both out at events and at home in the Leyland HQ.   We will need experience team members, and we also want to make it our goal to change lives we possible recruiting our staff from the young unemployed and ex service personnel, with training opportunities and apprenticeships.The internal layout of the gallery will be designed to fit the internal dimensions of the Main Gallery Footprint, but will also serve as a freestanding display unit for larger indoor Exhibition events ie. The NEC classic Car show and the Autosport International Racecar Show.The display structure will enable the viewing public to move freely and about the exhibition space with suitable lighting for each exhibit. with screen space for multi media exhibition.The Gallery Structure will also incorporate into the design the ability to be converted into a Theatre for all our live performances.     Before we go one..... I thought lets spend a paragraph or two on what the Gallery wants to show.  Motorsport Art has been around for as long as Motor sport. From Grand Prix Posters, to Corporate Graphics. From Professional artist to Amateur's. Fine art and Cartoons. Sculptors and Photographers.   The Scope of art is wide and varied. A glance at the internet and Social Media celebrates this range and passion from around the Motor sporting World, and we at Rallyist want the show of this diversity to the Motor sport Public. We want to hold specific themed weekends for Find Art, for Photography, for Sculpture, and my own favourite Cartoon Art.     We intend to Beg, Steal (Well perhaps not steal) and Borrow Art from around the world to display the Gallery. With Specific themed displays by single Artist, and themed Displays for new artist.      It is the aim of the Rallyist Motorsport Art Gallery to display as much art as we can by as many Artist as we can. Every Display at every event will be different. Themed events and displays will be on offer, included weekends dedicated to cartooning, photography, poster art, and Portraits.      This will require us to have access to a good supply of art.     To help with this task we will be putting together a Directory of Art and Artists to help keep the displays fresh and original.      The directory will contain the Artists Biography, examples of artwork, and contact details. This book will be available to the public in both bound and soft cover versions. Directory information will also be listed on the Rallyist Publications website.      Details about inclusion to the Directory can be found on the Rallyist Publications website.    The Gallery Theatre space at Motorsport events is a most exciting addition to our Gallery project. Offering a Stage for One Man Shows, Forums, Stand-ups, Bands, and Plays.     Many major Motorsport events are staged over several days. The Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Silverstone Classics, The Oulton Park Gold cup, Race Retro, to name the major players. Naturally the Gallery will remain open for evening viewings but we at Rallyist wanted something more than, just leaving the lights on.We would like to stage a Motorsport related play within out Theatre on our own stage.     A suitable story has been found, research into the stage-play version 'ongoing' and investigations into contacting relevant Agents for Rights to follow. I don't want to compromise plans regarding the name of the play at this stage....It will be worth it......Promise.     The Stage will require both sound and lighting with seating capacity of 50 to 120 persons. Final Stage shape and positioning will be subject to Directors requirements. Once the programme is funded and running updates on the progress of both the gallery and the stage play will be in our news letters.     The Gallery will be an imposing sight at Event trade villages the large inflatable Gallery structure will display Rallyist-Art Graphics on the exterior, and have all the Banners and Flags on display.In additions how ever the Gallery will also have static display in the area Forecourt, through which the entrance paths to the Main Gallery and the Shop will be laid.Using life sized models of Rallyist Characters, Forecourt displays will be built based on 50's Garage Scenes, WW2, 70's Rally scenes, and Iconic Cinema situations. Dependant on the venue. A definite pull for viewing public with have something to see even if they don't enter, but enough to whet their appetite to return later.    Supporting the gallery we will have The Rallyist Shop. The First point of contact for the visiting public to buy the artwork on show in the Gallery as well as prints and related Merchandise. (Note for the benefit of this presentation Rallyist-Art is being used.)A wide range of F1, WRC, and BTCC related merchandise will also be available. Point of sale displays by manufactures will also occupy the Shops 36sqm Floor space.     Naturally For all Supporters of our Project along with our potential Corporate Sponsors, Facilities will be available at the within gallery area, at events for a chance to have a sit down and enjoy refreshment and a bite to eat. Catering service will be attached.( ""You won’t believe my Brother-in-laws BBQ Ribs!!!"" )               The Lounge will also offer a great opportunity for Business Meetings, and could be available to entertain Guests, or there just to meet with friends.      We have gone into great detail on how the gallery will work, what it will look like, the functions it will full fill, even the team required to make it work. However the main selling point for the Rallyist Motorsport Art Gallery is ' where it needs to be', so find below a list of potential venues.A run down of the activity following our hitting the target of £35000 for the Rallyist Motor Sport Art Gallery.    With the Target under out belt we will start work on a Building the 10m x 10m Gallery and 100sqm internal Layout for both the Art Gallery and Theatre, At this early stage the Shop will be incorporated inside the main structure. This will require an industrial premises working as Workshop Layout planning, Storage and Base HQ. The aim will be to start looking for two assistant at this stage. I will also be on the look out for Operations and Marketing managers.    Booking events will at this late stage of the year will be difficult but it should be possible to access later Rounds of The BTCC, Oulton Park Gold Cup, Rallyday and Wales Rally GB. plus next years Autosport Show, Rallyday, and Race Retro. We will also have to start planning next years NASCAR Euro series, (Yes we have to plan that far ahead!) These events will offer us great potential to show of the Gallery not just to the public, your good selves, but also future investors and sponsors.    With a physical structure we can touch, photograph, walk around, and film on locations, the way is open for TV coverage and interviews more press coverage opening the way for Larger Sponsorship Involvement.    Breaking through the £35k Target will allow us to book all the entire event programme for 2018/19 which should save us money. We will develop the team further, and greatly enhance our sponsorship programme. Investigations into more Dynamic Inflatable Gallery Structures will be undertaken looking at designs to capture the eye of the visiting Public.     The Rallyist 350 programme will continue as will the Artist Directory as a means of income. Also a programme for raising Arts council (Lottery) Funding will also be started.     Work will be undertaken to investigate the potential of a secondary gallery programme allowing teams to widen our events programme with the inclusion of middle east dates. Investigations into US and Australian programmes will also take place.Specialist Bundle   The Rallyist Motor sport Art gallery will be running a specialist Reward Bundle in the programme.In Business ?....

(1) Crowd Funding to establish the foundation for the project. Establishing Rallyist Publications Ltd, Model the smaller Gallery, and Building the team, (2) Attracting Business Investors, and strengthening the team, and building the Full size Gallery programme, (3) Arts Council ( Lottery Support ) Establishing the Galleries goal for Youth employment and training within the programme and Finally (4) Corporate Sponsorship. The Gallery will be a high visibility project ,right where it needs to be. Well placed for Sponsorship support.Time: It is now Ten Years since starting work on Rallyist Publications with a view to publishing my art and cartoon books ultimately developing the Idea through the use of my 4m x4m Trade stand, developing the Merchandise, and ultimately the goal of the Gallery. Currently I am the Project Leader, The logistics expert, Head of Marketing, Head of Project development, Head of Product Development. Driver, Rigger, oh yes and did I say Artist/Cartoonist. While I have no problem in coping with the above list, Creating the Artwork, Merchandise, and somewhere in the future another Book ( currently 4 years over due ). Taking Rallyist Publications and the gallery on will require me build a Team. I do not want to be the bottle neck in this programme.Current Political Environment: The Itinerary for the Gallery will include European Venues. The NASCAR Whelen Euro Series, The Masters Series and Historic F1, 24hrs Le Mans. with Other Potential events to be added Such as the German DTM Championship, and Moto GP. The Initial Planning in the itinerary is based on current membership of the EU, and therefore based on current cross boarder freedom. It is not yet possible to predict how this issue will develop. Therefore to will plan the Itinerary for EU Venues under current laws up to when the UK leave, and adjust review the Strategy as negotiations develop. An Option may be for the Rallyist Publications consider building a sister operation in Europe with a second Gallery, and from that possibly forming a Model for other Galleries to be Built and operated in the US and Australia.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rallyistgallery/the-rallyist-motor-sport-art-gallery-pt1?ref=discovery_category_newest,rallyistgallery/the-rallyist-motor-sport-art-gallery-pt1,"A Gallery for Motor Sport Inspired Art. Paintings, Sculptures, Photography, Cartoons, and Performing Arts.Our Goal.We Want To Build......BTCC, DTM, Masters Classics, GT, World Rally Championships, F1, IOM TT, Le Mans 24hrs, European NASCAR, World Rally Cross, European Drag Racing, and many more.    The Rallyist Motor Sport Art Gallery will exhibit the best in Motor Sport inspired art, in any medium,by Artist's from around the World.Poster Art, Drawings, Digital Art, Paintings, Sculptures, Crafts, Muti- Media, Photography, and my own favourite Cartooning. We want to attract and display work by both professional and the gifted amateur.     Running themed weekends and events. Constantly upgrading the Display and types of Exhibitions.   The Structure of the Gallery is planned around an Inflatable Cube with 100m² of Floor space. The Shop will have a 36m² with an addition 20m² Sponsors Lounge and a 18 - 20m Forecourt frontage Display area.     Several Events such as the Goodwood Revival and Festival of Speed, F1 Grand Prix weekends, The Oulton Park Gold Cup. The Le Mans 24hrs, The Isle Of Man T.T., European Drag Racing Championship, and Rounds of the World Rally Championship are all take place over several days. Naturally the Gallery can stay open late for the visiting public but Rallyist Publications want to go for something even more special.     We will be able to convert the Gallery into a Theatre for live Performances to present Motor Sport inspired Stage Plays at these major events.It will be possible to seat 80 Persons in the Theatre.    The Rallyist Motor Sport Art Gallery will have a 20m Frontage at Motor Sport Events. The Gallery it self standing 5m High. Large wall Graphics, Flags and Banners will all announce our presents but there is also scope for more.     Out side the Gallery in the Gallery Forecourt we will have on various displays dependant on the Theme of the weekend. Classics cars, Historic Rally and Racing Cars, Cars from TV and Cinema, Concept Cars, Boats, Aircraft, and even Rockets. Again Themed displays will be assembled such as 1950's pit scenes, and garages, all using life sizes Rallyist Cartoon Characters.       Even in the shop Rallyist wants to take the public in a new direction. Too often Artwork, prints, and merchandise can be found lurking on small table in small marquees. Not as much displayed as stacked. Not easy to sell your cherished work of art in this environment.( Note a bit of personal frustration here!!!)       The Shop will change the way we will even sell Artwork, Merchandise and related Motorsport wares and with it the way it is displayed. The Difference one could say between a Super market and a High Street boutique.     Building a Team for the Job in Hand.      Operations Manager, Site Manager,  Marketing Sales and Promotions, Stage Director, Actors, Art department Staff,  Drivers, Logistics, Riggers, Sound and Lighting, Catering, HS&E and HR. Some of the many roles we will be looking to create for the Team to support the Gallery, the Theatre, The Forecourt, the Sponsors Lounge, and the Shop, both out at events and at home in the Leyland HQ.       We will need experience team members, but we also want to make it our goal to change lives were possible by recruiting for some roles from the young unemployed and ex service personnel, with training opportunities and apprenticeships.       You will note that the Project goal is £35,000 this target will lay the foundations of the gallery as a business. Funding a base of operations, recruiting early essentialmembers and expertise into the Team,a studio work shop for gallery preparationand development, and most importantly, building a physical Gallery able to tour limited events, raising more awareness, Investment, and sponsorship.      We will need a few 'gofers' always an important and underrated breed are 'gofers'. Work will start on the necessary task of viewing and meeting potential exhibitors, and finally research into the first stage play production. We have a project in mind and need to explore existing rights, but that as they say is another story.......           The Rallyist Motor Sport Art Gallery campaign has been planned around two major Motor Sport events in 2018. The Autosport International Racing Car Show at the NEC Birmingham and RaceReto the Historic Motor Sport Show at Stoneleigh Park, Coventry. While the dates for these two events are close, they are not quite close enough.      It is for that reason the 2018 gallery campaign will be split into two sections. Part 1 with cover the Autosport Show, a 30 days Campaign target £20,000, and Part 2 another 30 day programme taking in Race Retro, target £15,000. A sound Business Improvement strategy based on bite sized pieces. ","The Key issues facing many artist wishing to Display Art at Motor Sport events is the cost of those few Square meters of turf on which the Stall Stands.  Naturally the cost dictates the size. The Rallyist Stand is 4m x 4m and it has served for 9 Years. However in order to cover some of the cost of attending these events, a wide variety of art and merchandise is required to be also displayed turning the Gallery into a shop.The Rallyist Motorsport Art Gallery will approach the problem in a radically different way. We will be looking at Sponsorship to cover the running cost of the Gallery, Sponsor require visibility, so a simple 4mx4m Marquee is out, so to are small club rallies and out of the way venues. We have to plan for the bigger events, bigger Venues, and bigger Championships they do cost more.....a lot more but in return sponsor will get more visibility.By planning around a full 26 event Itinerary we will also be better placed to negotiate prices deals for multiple events with track owners and organisers.The Gallery will transform for being a Trade Stand to being an Attraction."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterdaskaloff/clyde-cooper-mystery-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,peterdaskaloff/clyde-cooper-mystery-feature-film,"Hello,I’m Peter Daskaloff.I wrote, produced and directed an independent feature film, Clyde Cooper. It was an exciting, although a difficult journey, but we made it.The film is about a Silicon Valley private detective, Clyde Cooper, who is hired by a tech investor to find a missing woman, the love of his life, who had mysteriously disappeared. Following dubious leads, Cooper runs into an odd ring of strange women, and weird characters until he finds much more than what he’s bargaining for.It’s a campy and humorous tale about a lone detective plagued with bad luck, who doesn’t take himself too seriously.The film has won a number of awards on festivals around the world.We have completed all work on the film, and it’s ready to be released. But we exhausted all our financial resources. So we need help for the final push -- putting the film out.We need money for publicity and advertising, because what’s the purpose of releasing a film if people don’t know about it. It would be dead on arrival!Today, the world is so oversaturated with big studio films, that a small indie film like this needs a solid shot in the arm to get noticed. Once it gets noticed, I’m sure the word will spread and the film will grow legs, and walk on further, all by itself.We have put together a modest but solid promotion plan.We will hire a publicity firm that specializes in indie films, October Coast, to promote the film through online publications, movie magazines, and movie blog sites. This will cost $800.00We will start an advertising campaign on Google, Facebook and Instagram at total cost of $7,000.00. It will be a video ad campaign, which means we pay the platforms only if someone watches the trailer for over 30 seconds. The $7,000.00 will buy us approximately 300K views of the trailer, which is a good start. If we’re fortunate enough to raise more money, it will buy us more views of the trailer, it’s that simple.We’re so proud of this film. Thank you in advance for your support. It will take us where we’re going.Film website: https://www.clydecoopermovie.com","Since the film is complete, there is no risk that you wouldn't get your reward. The film poster will be out of the printing shop by November 22. The Blu-ray disks will be available by November 22 as well. The release date is set to November 22, Thanksgiving. The film will be available on Amazon, Vimeo, iTunes and other streaming platforms. We just want to make sure people know the film exist. It's an existential thing!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterdaskaloff/bloodstained-a-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,peterdaskaloff/bloodstained-a-feature-film,"Bloodstained is a feature film which is being produced by Peter Daskaloff and Olivia Daskaloff -- a father/daughter team.The film is a psychological thriller about Sharyn Berkley, a happily married woman whose life is wrapped in a bow. After surgery for acute appendicitis, she wakes up in a strange facility where all is not what it seems. Distressed, Sharyn starts looking for an exit, but finds none. Roaming a maze of tunneling corridors stained with blood, she learns that this is a vast and terrifying facility which is inescapable. On her desperate quest to find a way out, Sharyn meets other patients. As their stories unravel, she discovers that nobody is who they claim to be. As Sharyn’s character unfolds we learn that she too is not who we think she is.The story is a gritty morality tale that dramatizes the rights and wrongs we do as people, even though our hearts may be in the right place. It has that commentary of Heaven and Hell and how the wrong choices we make in our lives may eventually make us pay a terrible price.We’re very passionate about this film, because the story is very relatable. It reveals that no matter how righteous we think we are, at some point in life, everyone has been in a situation where their moral compass has failed. But what do you do when that happens?The idea of Bloodstained came during post-production of Clyde Cooper.We were brainstorming what the next project would be. Then we came up with the concept of a young mother whose present life is picture-perfect, but a horrible truth that is buried in her past could be revealed only if she is placed in extreme paranormal environment.We love films that make us doubt the reality of what’s happening and give us insight into other realms. And Bloodstained is one of those -- A challenging and rewarding film to work on and it will be a thrill to watch.Bloodstained has been in the works for over two years. The script was submitted to a number of screenplay writing contests and has won three awards, and it is available upon request.We have our own top-of-the-line film equipment -- camera, lenses and lighting, necessary to make the film. We have assembled a fanatically dedicated cast and crew. We will be working with well-known principle actors, the names of whom we cannot disclose until production starts.We need additional funds to help us build the sets for our film. With your contributions, we plan to turn a warehouse space into a psychological labyrinth. The more money we can raise, the more monumental the picture will look. Bloodstained has potential to be a landmark film to measure up to the greatest in its genre, but only with a community effort, can we turn a small family production into just that.Please, check out our short film ""PainKiller"" which we made in order to test our new equipment and camera crew.","Making a low budget film is always challenging, but with our experience the risk of not making the film is minimal."

It teaches you how your body works, and then, combines that knowledge, together with food, helping you loose incredible amounts of weight in a record period of time.You will actually never feel that you are on a diet at all.But is it possible?It is very much possible, because, this method will allow you to eat as much as you want, and will only limit the intake of certain, small amount f ingredients, and only during the first 4 weeks of your diet program, one we call the Restriction Period.It will be very important for you to respect this time period, as those 4 weeks will actually be the time frame where all the magic will happen, all the toxins will leave your body, and, by my own experience, and experience of many others, will get you rid of 13 to 22 kilograms.Our bodies are great, almost perfect machines, and as such, those machines have some rules.Entire concept of Chrono Diet is made up to follow those rules of our bodies, and, if we just simply stick to them, results will start appearing very shortly after.You will be able to eat as much as you want.And that is absolute truth. Because Chrono will not limit you with the quantity that you take, but as the name Chrono (time) says, it will limit you only in wich periods of day do you take it, and it will put a time frame between your meals.It will teach you about which ingredients not to combine.It will teach you about witch food can you eat in the certain time of the day, as our bodies for example cannot process apple equally in the morning, and the evening, never the less, our bodies cannot process apple in the morning, at all.The Chrono method, is prooven to work, as many people from my surroundings lost incredible amounts of body fat, in very short periods of time.The best thing is...There is no chance of those pounds ever getting back, because, on Chrono, you will still supply your body with what ever your body needs, preventing it from turning on it's defense mechanisms, as what body does with most of the diets out there, gaining you even more weight one your diet is completed.There is no timeframeYou will be on a diet as much as you feel being on a diet. The only important thing will be to follow up to the 4 weeks restriction period, which is not going to be harder than the rest of the diet, yet it will only limit the intake of certain food.Not a diet, but the way of life!Once you've tried Chrono Method, it will become your way of life, as not only the pounds will go down, yet also, many health issues will wiped off. You will feel better in your own skin, you will feel healthier, younger.My guarantee!I will guarantee to everybody, that you will completely transform yourselves, that this book will be your life turning point, not only for the people with weight issues, but also for those who want to get their bodies to the best possible working conditions.The other book!As the first book will teach you about secrets of Chrono Diet up until smallest details, the second book will contain proven recipes, and most important of all, set of 300 menus. 100 For lunch, 100 for breakfast and 100 for dinner.Besides all of that, it will contain many food related tips and tricks.Who are we?I am Igor.

Whether they’re discussing the connection in the datacenter, their residential DSL, or the wireless connection via their mobile device, everyone references the bandwidth of their connection when talking about internet speed.But no one seems to ever bother mentioning the true culprit for slow (or fast) web browsing performance: Latency, measured in RTT (Round Trip Time). This is the measure of time it takes for your system to make a request to the server and receive a response back. I.E. one complete request loop. This is where the battle for speed when browsing the web is won and lost.Latency destroys your available bandwidth and so you pay for something which you can not use.Now of course I realized that there are lots of things in place to make latency and RTT less of an issue. Advanced caching, pre-rendering of content where applicable so browsers don’t have to wait for ALL the content to finish downloading before the page starts rendering, etc. Those are all great and they help alleviate the pain of higher latency connections, but the reality is that in today’s internet using world bandwidth is very rarely a concern when simply browsing the web. Adding more bandwidth will not, in almost all cases, increase the speed with which you can load websites.Bandwidth is king of course, for multi-tasking on the web. If you’re the type to stream a video while downloading audio while uploading pictures while browsing the web while playing internet based games while running a fully functioning (and legal) torrent server out of your house…well then…you might want to stock up on bandwidth. But don’t let yourself be fooled into thinking that paying for more bandwidth in and of itself will speed up internet browsing in general when only performing that one task.After 15 Years of hard Research and Development work and several international Patents I developed a new HTTP-SS (Single Stream) Technology to overcome exactly this Latency Problem when surfing the WEB.-Why we need backers? The technology is between a proof-of-concept and beta version and must be set under heavy load and stress tests to make it available for the consumer market.This can be accomplished within the next 3 Month for which I need this funding.Scheduled Time Line4 additional highly experienced C/C++ programmers have to be hired to accomplish this goal of a production version.Detailed Cost Calculation","RisksDue to the patented protection the risks are manageable.An equivalent approach is unlikely due to physical laws.It would only be possible that a competitor starts with a similar product, but this would inevitably result in a patent infringement.ChancesThe demand for bandwidth on the Internet apparently knows no limits and the telecommunications companies slowly reach the financial and technical boundaries in satisfying this demand for more and more bandwidth.However, the biggest demand and growth comes from the mobile sector in which it is chic to stream videos and other multimedia content directly to the smartphone.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872129499/tennis-motion-desktop?ref=discovery_category_newest,1872129499/tennis-motion-desktop,"With our multilingual Tennis Motion Desktop Application for Microsoft Office 2016/365 Coaches, Players, Clubs and Associations can manage their daily work easily and all Parties can exchange important Data secure over the integrated myCloud Service.Coaches can :Players can :Clubs can :And much more ....

Like all new apps there might be a few little bugs that didn't show up during testing but these will be squashed during this campaign.Fobo has been created to challenge the monopolised online dating industry and to revolutionise the offline dating industry. As the concept moves forward, Fobo plans to change the entire culture of the singles community and to create opportunities for single people that have never been seen before.This is your opportunity to join our vision by supporting Fobo with your pledge.So what does FOBO Stand for? Its simple…Why has Fobo been created?Because until software developers find a way of transmitting the combination of six hormones that make up what is commonly know as “Chemistry,” face to face meetings will always be more successful than technical solutions.So why support Fobo? Because Fobo has figured out a way of merging a range of opportunities, thrown some education to the mix and has already started building the world’s first fully moderated singles community.Why is Fobo being built as a community? Because communities have guidelines, acceptable and unacceptable standards of behaviour and the world is ready for fresh approach to dating.How is Fobo different? Fobo has all the functionality you would expect to find on Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Bumble etc but without any of the associated costs. Fobo has created new premium content along with innovative ways of generating new lines of intuitive revenue. This will help us grow the population and expand the communities.But what else is different?This is only the start. It would have been crazy to release our best features in Version 1 for our competitors to copy.There are three years of improvements and updates scheduled each adding a new dimension to the industry and more opportunities for community members. With your support we aim to release Version 2 in March 2019.Fobo Singles Saturdays on Facebook is where the concept was started. The groups already have thousands of members and are growing daily with zero advertising spend.For those who would like to check out the legal stuff Fobo is a UK registered company.Company number : 10616183 and it is also SEIS registered.SEIS reference : WMBC/IUR/S0970/3001913839/SCEC. Start date July 2017.Shareholding : The founder owns 100% of the company shares.If you have any other questions please do not hesitate in asking. So what are you waiting for?Pledge today, download the app and let all your single friends know there’s a new, independent dating app in town.Follow Fobo on.Thank you for reading.","Fobo isn't really facing any risks and our only challenge is raising funds to upscale and drive the concept forward and that’s where you can help by taking advantage of our Kickstarter rewards.Fobo has had great support from Facebook and there are many similarities in the way Fobo dating and Facebook dating work which hopefully means we are on to something special.Fobo will be the first truly independent dating app to launch in years and hasn't had any startup or external funding from anywhere. Finally, what Fobo has planned over the next few versions will change the direction of the industry forever.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1746793830/fobo-meet-real-people-in-real-life?ref=discovery_category_newest,1746793830/fobo-meet-real-people-in-real-life,"Thank you for viewing the FOBO campaign. Let’s start with a well known quote.How many times have you downloaded the same old dating apps, hoping to meet someone, only to get the same old results then deleted it?Another well known quote.The reality is dating and finding meaningful relationships worked perfectly well until the advent of online dating. Take a look at your parents generation, they probably met through work, on a night out, through a common interest, mutual friends, on holiday or one of the many ways people used to meet before the internet.Here’s a new quote which we hope will become equally well known:Yes, that’s the simple beauty of FOBO. We recognised one of the main reasons that the number of single people continues to grow is that swiping left or right to find a connection is not the answer. FOBO is going to change dating apps in to a place of engagement, education and real life connections. Bold claim. At FOBO we know why 90% of singles are single. We will reveal this in full when the app is properly established. Any sooner would lead to the major brands copying FOBO.Time for a question.If you were confident enough to approach 100 people that you were attracted to in real life, do you think you would get more dates than you do from dating apps?The answer? You most definitely would!How can we be so sure?There are multiple reasons why the number of single people is growing; we know those reasons, and step by step, FOBO will help build your confidence, skill set and understanding, until you find a genuine connection.Why support FOBO? Because until software developers find a way of transmitting the combination of 6 hormones that make up what is commonly known as “Chemistry,” face to face meetings will always be more successful than technical or algorithm solutions. These solutions only favor the most attractive people.A bit of trivia to share with your friends...Did you know, that women on Tinder only swipe right on 12% of men's profiles meaning 88% of men get rejected. And that the top 78% of women are chasing the top 20% of men. Google The Tinder Economy. However, this is not exclusive to Tinder.(Source : medium.com)In the UK eharmony advertise on TV that somebody finds love every 14 minutes.So lets look at the math's of that. eharmony have 4.5 million UK members and one finds love every 14 minutes. This equals 4.29 people every hour, 103 every day totalling 37,595 every year. If you divide the number of eharmony members by the number of people who find love you can work out your chances of meeting someone through eharmony.Calculations : 37,595 find love / 4,500,000 UK members = 0.0083% chances of finding love or less than 1%.(Membership Source : whichdate.co.uk)The reality is that the current dating providers either don't understand attraction or if they do, they ensure that their members stay perpetually single so that they can continue to charge app upgrade fees.How is FOBO different?Why is FOBO being built as a community? Because communities have guidelines, acceptable and unacceptable standards of behavior and the world is ready for fresh, local approach to dating.Meet the Team❤️ Terry - After learning that the number of singles was forecast to grow for the foreseeable future Terry had one question, ""Why?"" He then spent 3 years studying and testing online and offline dating. Once he had found the reasons and a solution the next step was to start building FOBO. ""Raising funding for a dating app is almost impossible, but FOBO is all about local communities, so crowdfunding and sharing our journey with those who's lives we aim to improve is an obvious match for FOBO. We believe that once people understand why they are single, and we equip them with the knowledge to change that, that there is a real possibility of people finding genuin, lasting connections.❤️ Cam - Has project managed the app development. He has many years of experience as a Technical PM and its this experience that enabled the development of a beta version of FOBO with a budget of only £30,000. ""Knowing the longer term plans for FOBO the main challenge was to develop a MVP on a such small budget. The beta isn't perfect but its a good start and if you look at Air BnB and Stripes MVP's I don't think we've done too badly.""❤️ Alex - With years of web and app development of experience working for all kinds of clients from private individuals right through to government contracts including working on the London 2012 Olympics Alex is a great coder to have on board. We would love him to have some more help sometimes as he is often up working until 3am. ""Why do I do it? Because I love helping to build solutions that have the ability to change peoples lives.""❤️ Rob - is our branding, UX and awareness guy. Rob's is a highly experienced multi channel marketing and digital marketing specialist. Rob has worked on projects for some of the biggest Global brands in the World including Fitbit, British Airways, Andrex, Dewalt, Braun, Unilever and many more. ""Once I understood where FOBO plans to take the brand and the positive impact this will have on people's lives it was an easy decision to CO Found FOBO. The biggest challenge at this stage is getting from being an MVP to becoming a fully functional app, after that it will be easy. With the new products we have planned, FOBO could become the ""Go to"" app for everyone, including those in relationships.""❤️ Everyone who supports FOBO will be listed in the app and on the site as a FOBO VISIONARY, as a big thank you.❤️Thank you for checking out the FOBO campaign.","Fobo faces the same risks and challenges as any startup. The hardest phase for Fobo is the current one. If we can get version one of the app fully functional, with all the functionality in app and not depending on other company's APIs, we will be in a stable place and able to build upon this much more easily.❤️ The ideal scenario is to build Fobo through member support and we thank anyone who supports our challenge.We also welcome interest from all potential investors. Volunteer app developers we'd be happy to hear from too 😁"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838086800/manicfactory-customizable-fashion-sneakers?ref=discovery_category_newest,1838086800/manicfactory-customizable-fashion-sneakers,"Hello, we are a family business dedicated to the manufacture of fashion footwear for more than 20 years. We are the third generation in our family of footwear manufacturers.We make trendy shoes through a traditional process called vulcanized. The entire manufacturing process is internal and it is carried out in Elche (Alicante), international landmark city for footwear manufacturing.After many years manufacturing and wholesale marketing our shoes, we have decided to undertake a project to sell to the last customer through a footwear e-Commerce.We do not expect to become a temporary fashion brand, because we already know fashion changes. What we really want is to manufacture for the customer. What we intend with this project is to let our customers and fans collaborate with us in the design of the shoes.All our models are made in collaboration with people in a solidarity way, they like fashion and want something different from what typical brands offer.For years, brands have told us how to dress and what is supposed to be in fashion. It is time to change the roles and give to customers the opportunity to tell the brands what they want to wear.For this reason Manic is presented as an e-Commerce of shoes, where the user can customize the model he want and design it as he wish. The are many possibilities because you can customize up to 8 components of the shoe by adding the combinations you like the most. How many times do we find a model that we like but does not combine with the outfit we want to wear? We bring you the solution.Up to 3 initials can be put in the shoe if the customer wants. Ideal to make a gift to your partner, family or friends. An original and exclusive gift of handmade quality.Manic shoes are made of high quality materials and the soles are 100% rubber. It emphasizes its comfort and adjustment to the foot. Moreover, the traditional process used makes the soles of the shoes more resistant. We have been making footwear all our lives, if there is anything we can do well, it is this.In addition, most of our models are made with 100% vegan materials for those people who prefer to live a lifestyle committed to the animal world sustainability.We have done a test with 5 young people, which have customized their slippers. The video shown at the beginning is a slipper made for one of them. Here you can see the result:",We have come to Kickstarter because right now we do not have the capacity to finance the e-Commerce project and the advertising expenses necessary to launch the product to the market. But we do have everything necessary to manufacture them. We have a factory with more than 20 years producing all kinds of fashion sneakers with an excellent team with a lot of experience in the sector.We have been working on this project for more than one year and it is time to make it real. The owners of the company are father and son. We together with our team want to achieve the dream of manufacturing for the client.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838086800/manic-custom-new-sneaker-collection?ref=discovery_category_newest,1838086800/manic-custom-new-sneaker-collection,"What is Manic Custom? Manic Custom is what you want it to be.Manic was born out of the idea that each person has a unique style and that the current shoe market does not offer the possibility for an individual to have a say in what is fashionable.My family and I have been shoe manufacturers for more than 50 years. My father and I are the current owners of a shoe factory, which has been manufacturing for other companies for over 10 years.Now we propose to create a brand that offers everyone the possibility to find their own style within our brand and to create their own personalized unique shoes.At Manic anyone can find shoes that suit their style. How?1. Collection: Our catalog is created through surveys among our community on social media. It is our goal that all of the shoes that we produce are chosen by our community.2. Custom Shoes: Our website has a built-in 3D customizer, which allows you to customize several models of our shoes. Currently there are two models but we hope to add more as the project progresses. You can customize up to 9 elements of the shoe design, as well as you can add your initials or date to the design.At Manic Custom we manufacture our shoes unlike other brands on the market. The founding partners belong to a third generation(“founding partner” means “first generation”; maybe substitute “founding” with “current”)of shoe manufacturers in Elche, (the city known for shoe manufacturing). Our manufacturing method is 100% handmade and we use the highest quality materials in the creation of our products. Additionally, we have two collections of 100% vegan shoes (meaning that they are made without any animal-derived ingredients).Our vegan flash, like all the shoes in our vegan collections are carefully manufactured so that it does not contain any material or treatment that has animal origin.VEGAN FLASH MATERIALSTERRA MATERIALSSome elegant sneakers that you will fall in love with. They are the most comfortable due to the padded lining they carry and the thermoformed insole that adapts to your foot. You will not want to take them off.TRETTO MATERIALSKEEP MOVING MATERIALSWe have two models customizables:Customed in mobile:Customed ShoesCustomed in mobileCustomed shoesInitials We will incorporate new customizable elements to the models we already have and other surprise for a perfect customization.","Our family has been manufacturing shoes for more than 25 years, so we have enough experience to be able to deliver the products on time.For us there are 3 fundamental things for something to work: honesty, hard work and transparency.And so we want to transmit to our maximum commitment to the project to ensure the total success of the campaign and send on time the promised rewards.OUR PROMISE TO YOU: Whether it is good news or bad news, we will ALWAYS stay in communication with our backers. We promise to never leave you in the dark. We promise to be 100% transparent in all aspects of the campaign.Please keep an eye out for our survey in order for us to deliver our shoes in a timely manner.

I've done lots of shows as a Tina Turner impersonator and all-round singer. Last year I decided to bring out new music. I have been very sick 5 yrs ago and had to do something to get back on track. I managed to write, produce and record an album in the last 9 months. My very first album called ""Memories With A Gratitude"" using my bad and good experiences into positive messages. Very comforting music (according to all the listeners). Because of a lack of money (didn't have any income for 4 yrs!) I had to step into the world of midi (at my age hahaha) in order to do everything myself. So now I am very proud to have accomplished this.I have always been very positive and I am sure that music unites everything and everybody all around the world.Now I am writing the second album ""Sounds Of The World"" using different instruments from all around the world and put them old-school-wise in a new-school-jacket. In order to do so, I need to travel some countries for collabs on certain songs. Ofcourse I would like to mix everything in a good studio so the sounds get even better than I can do myself. To be able to do so, ofcourse I need the money to realize this project. I do a lot op filming and go ""live"" on FB to keep everybody informed about my where-abouts so everybody knows exactly what I am doing.For the ones who like to pledge, I offer my album ""Memories WIth A Gratitude"". I'll ship to every country or can make it able for you to download or simply send all the tracks by email.Positive as always, i'd like to thank you for making this possible.For previeuws you can also check my website: www.litaturner.nl","The only risk I can think off right now, would be...getting sick. All tools to create this album I have myself. The mixing can be done in any proper studio. The traveling I have to do myself."

But the film faced resistance and censorship from distributors who wanted a softer film for audiences in Latin America and other countries. At that point I decided take our film, make it even more daring and aligned with my vision by filming new scenes and reediting the entire film and have it ready for an unrestricted and uncensored digital release. After several months of work we are ready to release the version of the film that I always envisioned.The original investment in the film was $ 818,000 dollars and the total investment to create Fetish was an extra $112,400 dollars. Together the movies have a total investment of $930,400 dollars. Now our only dream is to put this film in front of as many people as we can by making a world wide social media marketing campaign to promote it.Thank you so much for checking out my project!Joaquin Rodriguez - Director""Fetish"" is a reality. The movie is completely and beautifully finished and the resources we need are to be able to distribute the movie worldwide without the restrictions, censorship or impositions of traditional distributors. We want the film to reach the largest number of people. Our passion is to make movies for audiences, not to put money in the bank.The story: Oskar Pratz is brilliant and handsome entrepreneur amassing an impressive fortune at a very young age. His lifestyle goes beyond the limits of imagination of most men. His liberal and open mentality can make him the perfect sexual partner for some women but a very dangerous one for others. Anabel is a young, beautiful and vibrant woman who lives a normal life with her modest job. One day after almost running over Anabel with his car, a spark of mutual attraction is inevitable and a torrid romance ensues.Not too long after the romance, Anabel begins to fall into Oskar’s sexual games and fetishes. Although Anabel tries to stay open-minded and plays along for a while, the fun and sexual games begin to decay and spiral downward into dangerous acts that lead to a shocking outcome.",This project doesn't have significant challenges or risks since the movie is completed. We are just keeping the credits open in oder to incorporate the names of those backers to choose the Executive Producer reward. The movie is ready to be released.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joaquindirector/fetish-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,joaquindirector/fetish-2,"StoryBackgroundFetish is a very personal film that has some scary things that I have witnessed in my journey as a filmmaker. I feel a close relationship with this film as I feel it's my own voice revealing concealed feelings, gender disparities, relationships truths and and deep rooted fetishes. Fetish is not an erotica film, it's actually a drama that has a strong sexual energy but nothing graphic or gross, as the film theme and plot are not centered in sex. However due to the nature of the film, sex is a driving force in the story of our 2 characters. My goal is to put this film in front of as many people as possible by making a world wide social media marketing campaign to promote it and stream it directly avoiding the filters of distributors and the red tape of networks.Fetish has the quality and characteristics of a big budget feature film and I'm absolutely positive that you will enjoy being part of it and you will feel proud of having your name on it. The total investment in the film so far is 1.1 million.We are so close and your contribution will allow me to finally release it :) My passion is to make movies for audiences, not to put money in the bank.Thank you so much for checking out my project!Joaquin Rodriguez - DirectorThe story: Oskar Pratz is brilliant and handsome entrepreneur amassing an impressive fortune at a very young age.

The Eden Trilogy is a project that I've dreamed about making for many years now, and with leaps and bounds in technology, the wait is hopefully almost over.For your consideration, this teaser trailer has been produced and directed entirely by myself.Visit my website below.www.eden-trilogy.comIt's been optimized for Smart Phones too. So Enjoy.Set in a not too distant future, where the earth is almost incapable of sustaining life, mankind has looked towards the stars.Eden was found, after years of searching deep space and it seemed that mankind was saved.Then a team of Archaeologists made a startling discovery. But what the Scientists did, could threaten our entire existence!No spoilers for now...I can't give anything away at such an early stage. With motion capture/facial performance capture software being more affordable then ever, what I could only dream about 5 years ago is now a reality. Most indie animation guys would strongly agree. Full body and facial motion capture that now allows indie artists like myself to not have to worry about the technology like before, but more about the actual performance of the actors, in an attempt to bring character driven stories to life in 3d, without huge teams of people or massive Hollywood budgets.More affordable, high end computers that allow 2k (full film resolution) rendering of scenes much, much faster than before, giving high production values to indie animators.As I mentioned, it has been 5 years since I first came up with a rough draft of the screenplay, which follows an investigation crew that has been sent to find out what has happened with loss of communications on Eden. I feel that from developing the story over so many years, it has really come into it's own, and there are many twists and turns that you wouldn't necessarily expect. Again, I wanted a Science Fiction story that has action and suspense, but also that is really character driven for a 3d animation feature film. Then I realized that one film just wasn't long enough. It would have to be broken into 3 parts to give a sense of scale to the events surrounding Eden and mankind.I've spent the last 12 months in pre-production: building sets, sourcing assets and making characters, finalizing the script and story boarding. Spending hours in front of my computers trying to come up with convincing characters/textures, sets and creating amazing visuals for the show.As with any 3d animated venture, time is the major factor. With funding from the Kickstarter community, I will be able to devote all my time during production, hire a larger studio for my motion capture equipment (allowing it's full potential to be realized) hire actors to bring stunning realism in a 3d world with their talents via performance capture, and have funding to pay for professional sound mixing and film score for the finished movie.Below is the character line up. Thought I would share some cool stuff on how a project like this and many of the shots are rendered then composited together. It does take a lot of hard work planning and executing sequences. EnjoyVFX Breakdown 1Making characters believable in a 3d enviroment can be tricky. Layers are added on top of the original render to simulate real light, flares, snow etc.VFX Breakdown 2This sequence was a little trickier to give the illusion of snow coming through the large doors. Several different dust layers were added to give a sense of realism.VFX Breakdown 3Space scenes, some might think can be easy to create, aren't always that straight forward, especially when you have fast panning camera movement. Character Texturing BreakdownTrying to create realistic 3d characters can be quite daunting. I have spent a lot of time researching and developing the look for my characters in this project. To build believable skin requires many layers all added together to simulate sub surface scattering in real skin. Take a look.No good deed should go without reward. I hope that the rewards for pledges made will get the interest and vision of what could become an amazing Scifi series of films. This film is as much about the kickstarter community as it is about myself. I want all of you that pledge to have a piece. How knows where it could end up.

With Dead Salvage, I wanted to do a different take on some of the off-world colony sci-fi films that have been done in the past. Now I know that at first glance, this project may seem like all the others, but it has a much darker and much more realistic premise. Sometime in the near future, when planet Earth is almost incapable of sustaining life, all the nations from around the globe came together to create the U.W.C. (United World Civilization).But with food and water shortages common place, an emergency plan was needed.A 10year space project was formulated to find another suitable, inhabitable planet. It was the most incredible deep space exploration mission ever conceived and executed. After 20 years, and not a moment too soon, we found a planet that could sustain us, and was known from that day as Eden.But, on the 21st February 2152, Eden colony went dark. No further communications were received. A rescue mission was put into effect to find out what happened on Eden, and this is where the story of Dead Salvage begins.The Eden Chronicles, a series of of feature films set in a distant future, is something that I've been working on for the last 5 years. Dead Salvage, and the films that follow, are a labor of love, and projects that I'm deeply excited about!I have 10+ years of knowledge in 3D animation and storytelling, and have teamed up with several experienced filmmakers and a cast of talented voice actors to bring you an action-packed science fiction horror film like nothing on the market today. The project is a large undertaking, but my team and I are confident and more than capable of delivering this professional, high-quality feature film!We tried to keep the rewards as simple to understand as possible - but there is a lot we have to offer at many different perk levels, so we think we've got something for everyone!DIGITAL REWARDS:From wallpapers, thank-you's on our website, a digital comic prequel, the film score/soundtrack, a PDF copy of the screenplay, HD digital copies, your name in the credits... there are many different reward tiers to suit whatever your specific interest may be! Or, for pledging £9, you can have each and every digital reward we have to offer!PHYSICAL REWARDS:BLU-RAYS AND DVDS!We will of course be offering special edition 2-Disc Blu-Rays and DVDs of the finished film, each with as many extras as we can manage! We will be printing from both the US and UK to ensure the quickest delivery as soon as the film is finished.SIGNED CAST PHOTOS!We have planned a pretty epic cast photo of the 10 members of the rescue crew sent to Eden Colony! These photos will be professionally shot and printed, and signed by our voice actors!SIGNED SCREENPLAYS!Our finished screenplay will be printed and signed, and will include not only the original screenplay but lots of extras like artwork, storyboards, and behind-the-scenes photos!SPECIALTY & LIMITED REWARD TIERS:For those looking for more unique pledge levels, we are offering a limited number of pledge levels that include voice roles in the film, Executive and Associate Producer credits in the film (and on IMDB), physical replica helmets and suits fabricated by Midnight Armour (and by Jesse Lagers himself). Some of these will go fast so be sure to pledge early!In the event that we exceed our main funding goal, we have put together some fun stretch goals for our backers!£26,000 - 3D VERSION OF THE FILM ADDED TO ALL BLU-RAYS!When we hit this pledge amount, backers whose pledges include a Blu-Ray copy of the film will also receive a 3D version at no extra cost!£29,000 - TO BE ANNOUNCED!This project is a massive undertaking, and we are asking for a significant amount of funding to make this concept a reality. A budget of £23,895 isn't that much to work with on a project of this scale, but it is the absolute minimum we need to complete this project without sacrificing quality. As well as having already developed the script and storyboards, I have also prepared all the characters and environments required to produce this quality feature-length film (current running time is approximately 100 minutes).I have already invested over a year of personal time into preparing this film, plus a substantial amount of personal money. As well buying 3 new 6 core AMD PC's to assist with the lengthy render times, I have purchased my very own motion capture system for all the animations in the film. Cheap, it was not... but it's a crucial piece of tech that I couldn't do without, and with that increased speed of character animation, we can finish the film that much faster.ANIMATION AND PRODUCTION TIMEAnimation is the most costly part of the production. Having an entirely computer animated film demands more time in front of the computer than anything else. I will be the primary editor on the film, but will need to bring in some help to get it finished in a timely fashion.A portion of the funds will go towards the rental of a large studio space, which is required to lock down the required motion capture for the film. Studio space isn't cheap, but my existing space is quite small, and simply put - the larger the motion capture space, the more dynamic the animation will be. VOICE TALENTI have been so overwhelmed by the support that I have gotten for this low budget feature! We have had some exceptional actors from around the globe audition for our film, and I know you will be pleased with the cast we have hired. And trust me, they are pretty darn good.FILM SCORE & SOUNDTRACKThis to me is one of the most important assets to telling a story. Without an amazing film score, you don't have an amazing film. Try watching one of your favorite films with the sound turned down. Amazing how different it will be.I have found an excellent film composer, Greg De Lulio, to work with on this project. We will also be commissioning some hard-hitting music tracks to feature during some of our most action-packed scenes, so we are set to have a pretty outstanding music score!POST PRODUCTION & DISTRIBUTIONThis is another key element. What's the point of doing all of this if you don't have an end product for people to see? As well as repaying all of our backers with the rewards they have pledged for, we will need to make large enough initial run of DVDs, Blu-Rays, and other physical rewards. Funds will also be needed for packaging materials and shipping fees.And, a little bit of funding for promotion goes along way. We will need to spread the word about Dead Salvage long after the campaign ends, and with the support we gain from there, we hope to be in a position to fund the next chapter in the Eden Chronicles universe!KICKSTARTER & AMAZON PROCESSING FEESKickstarter and Amazon take a combined 8-10% of the funds we raise, so we will only end up with 90% of the raised funds to work with.MISC. PRODUCTION COSTS & FEESThere will be several minor costs here and there, such as transporting hard drives securely between animators in the US and UK, promotional materials, ComiCon fees (it is our hope that the film will be available before the 2015 Emerald City ComiCon, and we want to be there to show you all!), and the like.We have worked hard to put together a comprehensive budget that finely details every aspect of the film's costs, and it has helped us to really visualize the necessary expenses involved. We want to make this movie the best it can be, and proper budgeting has helped us come up with the absolute minimum required to do just that.WANT A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT OUR BUDGET?No problem! We want to be completely transparent with our process and that includes showing you exactly where every dollar is going. Most of these figures are based on quotes we have obtained by the the businesses providing each service, actor stipends, and estimates of reward fulfillment prices. We have spent months comparing rates to ensure we are getting the best deals on the most professional products/services.You can download a copy of our budget here.  The biggest way to help us is obviously by making a pledge for one of the great rewards we have listed. But, if you can't support us monetarily you can still spread the world and help us get some exposure! This project is a big undertaking, so we need all the help we can get!Please share our Kickstarter on your Facebook, Twitter, etc!SHORTLINK FOR SHARING PROJECTYou can also follow us on:Facebook: The Eden ChroniclesThe Eden Chronicles Official Twitter The Eden ChroniclesDead Salvage Movie Twitter: Dead SalvageYouTube: Dead SalvageInstagram: Dead Salvage*we just set up our Twitter & Instagram so there isn't much there yet, but stay tuned for updates!OFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.DeadSalvage.comIMDB: Title page is in progress!Seriously guys, thank you for taking the time to check out our project. We have been working tirelessly on pre-production for so long that it is hard to believe that we are finally here! It is so nerve-wracking but at the same time, so exciting to finally put it into your hands! All your help and support along the way has kept us motivated, and we are so grateful!","We are a professional, motivated team of filmmakers and actors, but every production has its challenges and hurdles.One challenge will probably be the coordination of schedules for the voice over studio time.  We expect to spend 7-10 total days total logging everyone's lines, and since this is a CG film, we are confident that we can work around people's schedules and locations and get the lines logged in a timely manner.The other challenge will be the daunting task of animating an entire feature film.  But, we have given ourselves sufficient time to finish with a goal of attending the 2015 Emerald City ComiCon with the completed film.All other aspects of production have been planned out carefully and we are prepared for any hurdles that get thrown at us!"

You will be able to build multiple study decks and review until you know it.As an instructor, I have seen students lose sleep and shed many tears of frustration over learning human anatomy. The challenges are:I wanted to create something that is accurate, easy on the eyes and engaging. If you never thought science or biology was 'your thing', this will change your mind. This app is more then memorizing the data. It is a completely new way to learn muscles and bones. My students hear me say, ""the body is amazing"" about 10 times a day. It is and I want anyone that wants to know more about it to have access to it.Why $24,000?$24,000 is not a random number. We have invested the last three years to personally develop the images, initial prototype, design and legal matters. It's time to get this app done! Our developer, Richard Hart, has done some amazing work and provided terrific feedback during our early phases. He is now teaching full time with BCIT. We have reached out to a local development group, Steamclock Software (steamclock.com). They are skilled, educated and knowledgeable and understand what our vision is. For the most basic functionality, the coding and polishing will be $24,000. For a highly polished, interactive app, the proposal estimate is $52,000. This would include:Design: includes the wireframes and navigation design, visual design, custom asset generation and prep, gameplay design and improvements. This phase is COMPLETED.iPad App: includes coding, navigation flow, gameplay behaviour and polish, visual polish, integration of levels and content. The flash cards include construction of deck list, adding a deck, settings, testing screen, additional features, visual polish and reporting.Testing and Deployment: includes polish and iteration, QA, bug fixing and app store submission.We are fundraising for the following:$24,000-$42,00 to finish the iPad App and the Testing and Deployment phases. The $24,000 will cover the basic functionality.* $42,000 would be for a highly polished, animated and interactive app. We are currently focusing on basic functionality. $2,400 to go to Kickstarter fees$1,350 to pay for the expenses of manufacturing and shipping (to us and to you) of the rewards.I acknowledge $24,000-$42,000 is a lot. That is how much an good app takes. We are crowdfunding for the most basic amount and plan on launching stretch goals to make the app even better. I promise you Humanatomy will be something great!*Note: I have been asked, ""Why not contract over seas? The work could be done at a much lower rate."" My answer is ""Even though over seas coders can be 1/3-1/2 the cost, they only code what you say. I am on a steep learning curve and don't want to waste time, energy and funding by having designs and codes being tested then requiring recoding or redesigning. Steamclock is a design team and they understand what we want to create. They have put in their expertise and input. We have a dialogue so that everything can be completed in an efficient and timely manner. Our estimate from full funding is 4-5 weeks til Humanatomy can be shipped to the App Store.""Why Support Humanatomy?What are People saying about the Humanatomy Campaign?""I wish you guys good luck, i was hoping to bone up on some of the weaker points in my anatomy as a practicing physician."" - Greg W.""I can't tell you how many times I wished there was something like your app available out there other than my heavy Netter's Human Anatomy book and 2 other anatomy books."" - T.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimberlybourne/sunbeam-file-folders?ref=discovery_category_newest,kimberlybourne/sunbeam-file-folders,"This year, I was assigned to teach the Sunbeams (3-4 year olds) in our local LDS ward. My teaching companion and I struggled to find cute, appropriate, and doctrinally correct ways to teach the Sunbeams the gospel principles in each lesson. Especially when there was so much overlap in the manual. Instead, we came up with these File Folder Games to accompany each lesson to reinforce the concepts each week and we found a talented illustrator to do custom artwork for each lesson. Unfortunately, my budget ran out in May and I was unable to continue paying the illustrator to continue the artwork.The illustrator and I sat down and calculated what amount would safely cover the artwork necessary to complete all 46 lessons in the Primary 1 (Sunbeams) Manual. The $5,000 will cover all of the lessons and even leaves a cushion to be able to do additional Games and Visual Aides to go with the lessons for Scripture Stories and additional Gospel Principles in the lessons.By offering the different pledge categories in varying price ranges, we are hoping we can quickly fund the project and have the entire project completed in September of this year.All File Folders will have the same quality standard you can find on my Etsy shop products. For those who purchase the complete set ($50), you will receive each File Folder as they are completed so you can get your hands on them as fast as possible. We will start where with the lesson that is being taught the week funded so that you can have them to accompany your class from the beginning of the project. Once we finish out the year's lessons, we will go back and fill in the gaps from earlier in the year.Here are images of some of the other file folders which are already completed (note, all pieces and folders are printable on 8.5x11 paper/cardstock): ","I don't foresee any challenges as I am confident the amount will cover the illustrations for the remaining lessons.  However, any extra money left over will go to cover extra illustrations for the manual such as scripture stories or additional class activities and visual aides.  Those who purchase the complete set ($50) will receive any of these in addition to just the class File Folders.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimberlybourne/main-street-market-designs-version-20-the-quilted?ref=discovery_category_newest,kimberlybourne/main-street-market-designs-version-20-the-quilted,"Thank you for taking the time to look at my proposal and consider the value in helping me achieve this new addition to my growing business, Main Street Market Designs. First, I should tell you a little about myself.My name is Kimberly Bourne. In 2010, I started taking my first quilt class. It was a block-of-the-month class taught in the neighborhood. I completely fell in love with quilting! I had no idea when I agreed to take the class, that this was going to become my new hobby/passion/business. Throughout the last five years, this journey has included designing and writing over 30 new quilt patterns, releasing my own fabric collection, publishing patterns and having my work featured in top quilting magazines and catalogs, and so much more! I have been able to travel and make new friends from many teaching engagements and from social media. I look forward to the next chapter of this business which is to offer long-arm quilting services to others. Having watched other long-arm quilters transform quilt tops into magnificent works of art, I determined to also do that with my own quilts as well as for beautiful quilt tops of others. With my background in graphic design and art, this is a natural progression for me to pursue. Below are some of my sample sketches showing the quality of the quilting designs.First of all, thank you! Your pledges are very important to me! I have tried to come up with rewards that would mean the most to you, my supporters.For the quilters, I have included pattern bundles or quilting services. Pattern Bundles$10.00 :: One (1) Digital Quilt Pattern of your choice.$18.00 :: Two (2) Digital Quilt Patterns of your choice.$24.00 :: Three (3) Digital Quilt Patterns of your choice.$30.00 :: Native American Bundle- Four (4) Native American Inspired Digital Quilt Patterns including MSM123 ""Santa Fe"", MSM124 ""Mesa"", MSM125 ""Olympus"", and MSM126 ""Tacoma"". A great addition to any pattern stash.$55.00 :: Curved Piecing Bundle - Nine (9) Digital Quilt Patterns showcasing the curved piecing technique. Patterns include MSM114 ""Allyson"", MSM116 ""Natalie"", MSM117 ""Bridgette"", MSM122 ""Matthew"", MSM129 ""Karen"", MSM130 ""Delilah"", MSM131 ""Roadster"", MSM132 ""Bloom"", and MSM133 ""In the Rough"". A great addition to any pattern stash.$180.00 :: Complete Pattern Bundle - Thirty-Three (33) Digital Quilt Patterns showcasing the designs of Kimberly Bourne.  All Patterns listed above are included. The ultimate addition to any pattern stash.Quilting ServicesOf course, the best and most appropriate reward I can offer to my supporters, with a new long-arm quilting machine, is quilting services. The listed rates are exclusive for Supporters during this Kickstarter Campaign. Once the campaign is completed rates will be starting at double the listed rates.The Pledge Rewards have been divided into four different categories: All-Over (not custom), Semi-Custom, Custom, & Heirloom Custom.  You can calculate your pledge (see below) to accommodate as many quilts as you would like.  Multiple quilting styles may be factored into your pledge although we ask that you use only one style per quilt.To help in knowing what styles are when trying to calculate your pledge amounts, I've included a description of each:All-Over: This style of quilting is using the same design ""all-over"" the quilt. Usually using a repetitive design such as stippling, flowers, and geometric lines and shapes. I will have a catalog of potential designs for you to choose from. Everything from cars, trains, butterflies and flowers to lines, circles, triangles and more. This is great for quilts that just need the basics so that the quilt can be used and loved for years.Semi-Custom: This style of quilting is kind of the middle ground of ""All-Over"" and ""Custom"". It takes it a step further than just using one design over the entire quilt and lets you emphasize borders/sashing or a few spots on the quilt. But the majority of the quilt is still using an ""all-over"" design.Custom: The most popular style of quilting is probably custom quilting. This uses a detailed design to accent the elements on the quilt. It is great for showcasing different block designs or to give an added dimension on the quilt. It is designed to still keep the quilt piecing design as the main feature when looking at the quilt but it adds a breath of life to the design as well. It may help to know that this is the quilting style I have requested on most of my quilts.Heirloom Custom: This style is what I and a few others consider as the ""quilted to death"" quilting. While heirloom quilting still takes into account the design of the quilt top itself, the heirloom custom style tends to steal the show. It is very tight, detailed quilting throughout the entire quilt. It is great for competition-level quilts or for very meaningful gifts that will become more of a showpiece than a quilt for everyday use. I know that these quilting services are not for everyone. Either you do not have any quilt tops ready or that are going to be ready, or you are not a quilter. But, there is still a way to support. For this campaign only, I am offering to make (piece) and quilt (longarm) a quilt just for you. Using fabrics available at the time, and with feedback from you on colors, styles, etc. I will make a custom heirloom quality quilt that will be a treasured quilt for years to come. Using only the best in 100% cotton quilter's weight cotton and beautiful workmanship, you will have a one-of-a-kind quilt of your own. These can be chosen from any of my existing quilt pattern designs or from upcoming pattern designs released before the start of the project. These are limited-edition and only offered during this campaign. Thank you for supporting Main Street Market Designs Version 2.0!!The Eclipse Quilt pictured above is designed and pieced by myself, Kimberly Bourne. However, because I do not yet have a long-arm quilting machine, I had my friend and trusted quilter transform my quilt top into the masterpiece that it is. Her name is Barbie Mills of The Quilting Mill. I can't wait to have a machine so I can do the same beautiful work she does.","The biggest challenge accompanying the funding of this project is where to put this large of a machine.  Luckily, in October of this year (2015), we will be moving into our own home that has a dedicated spot sizeable for this new addition.  The second biggest challenge will be developing the muscle memory to quilt.  Don't be alarmed though, this fall, I also gain 15 hours a week of extra practice time as my child starts school.  I should be fine-tuning my artistic quilting skills in no time.Of course, family emergencies, significant interference by mother-nature, or ""the collapse of the world as we know it"" have the potential to slow our schedule down.  But, I will always keep my Kickstarter supporters updated if any delays develop."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1646073502/ingenious-hat?ref=discovery_category_newest,1646073502/ingenious-hat,"We had the good idea to create and sell an INGENIOUS HAT which put together several functions and can be used at large scale.The focus of our project is to create a prototype.  According to our project, INGENIOUS HAT will show you on an electronic digital display the following information: Temperature indoor and out, Humidity, Time, Altitude, Ultraviolet (UV) index and Air Pollution; It will alerted you by an ALARM when Air Pollution is too high or the UV rays are harmful. We would need a financial support to make the prototype in order to start the manufacturing of these hats in France and USA and sell them to potential customers by internet.It may also be suitable for trades man or professional employed for their safety in the sun or polluted areas. The most important parameters on our display are UV and Air Pollution Index.UV Index (UVI, SPF, SKIN): is to help people effectively protect themselves from UV radiation, which has health benefits in moderation but in excess causes sunburn, skin aging, DNA damage, skin cancer, immuno suppression, and eye damage such as cataracts. Air Pollution: Breathing polluted air can make your eyes and nose burn. It can irritate your throat and make breathing difficult. In fact, pollutants like tiny airborne particles and ground level ozone can trigger respiratory problems, especially for people with asthma. Today, nearly 30 million adults and children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma sufferers can be severely affected by air pollution. Air pollution can also aggravate health problems for the elderly and others with heart or respiratory diseases. Some toxic chemicals released in the air such as benzene or vinyl chloride are highly toxic and can cause cancer, birth defects, long term injury to the lungs, as well as brain and nerve damage. And in some cases, breathing these chemicals can even cause death. Other pollutants make their way up into the upper atmosphere, causing a thinning of the protective ozone layer. This has led to changes in the environment and dramatic increases in skin cancers and cataracts (eye damage). Seniors, parents of children with asthma, and people suffering from diabetes, heart or lung disease, can use Air Pollution Index to assess the immediate risk air pollution poses to your health and take steps to lessen that risk. Even if you’re relatively healthy, fit and active, you can consult Air Pollution to decide when and how much to exercise or work outdoors. All who love running outdoor and use INGENIOUS HAT in a city will be alerted by an ALARM when Air Pollution is too high or the UV rays are harmful.Our Electronic Digital Display with water and shock resistance is bright and clear, shows Temperature Indoor/Out, Humidity, Time, Altitude,Ultraviolet Index (UVI, SPF, SKIN), Air Pollution and Alarm. It is fixed in the front of the INGENIOUS HAT. The technical specifications for the Electronic Digital Display will be developed in conjunction with suppliers and designers. All full details can be found below:INGENIOUS HAT will be sold with an EXPLANATORY GUIDE about setting, operating system parameters, UV Index and Air Pollution levels. It will be available in multiple colors like bellow:  ","The focus of our project is to create a prototype. We will start shipping INGENIOUS HAT to our backers in September 2016. We will update you immediately if we run into supply chain issues. In all we do, our Kickstarter backers will come first.

SCULPTBODY offers many compelling advantages over other equipmentSCULPTBODY is a wearable device that tracks and identifies your different activities, evaluates your form, stress, stamina, force, counts your reps and sets, calculates the calories you burned and more others apps but the most important role is TO HELP YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAM GOALS.SCULPTBODY extracts complex biometric data directly from your body, providing an unparalleled level of insight into your physiology and performance. SCULPTBODY refines this knowledge into simple recommendations and notifications for people of all skill levels, while still providing the raw numbers for detailed analysis. True intelligence requires the ability to learn, and SCULPTBODY lives up to that title with adaptive capabilities that improve with every practice. You have all the freedom to choose what interests you most and offer us other ideas or optionsSCULPTBODY adds an incredible amount of context to your workout, not only do you have a complete digital log of your specific exercices. SCULPTBODY enables you to see how your body is affected (stress, muscle, stamina, respiration). You can see how rest affects each exercise, how quickly your body and your heart recovers, the quality of your form and more. SCULPTBODY can identify for example the beneficial action of the device / exercise on fast and slow muscle tissue that very significantly enhances the early uses and, unlike other devices / exercises smoothly and without injury. SCULPTBODY show your progress from repetition to repetition, about when you're fresh vs fatigued, provides visual, objective, easily interpreted data to improve your assessments, prevent and manage injuries.Moreover, thanks to this work smooth although deep, the body is brought to burn quite quickly its layers of extra fat to ensure the permanent supply of heat energy necessary to stress in muscles Therefore, if it's frequently used, SCULPTBODY can be a great way to sculpt your body and erase your cellulite layers. SCULPTBODY can track your body on the X, Y and Z axes. As to cardiovascular effects, it is perhaps worth recalling that thanks to its sensors, SCULPTBODY monitor in real time the cardiovascular system of your body, contributing to the proper functioning of blood circulation. Finally, the use of SCULPTBODY also had a very positive effect on bone density, thus preserving its users risk of osteoporosis or bone thinning, an advantage  not very accessible in practicing conventional sports. Even the best information is useless without a practical understanding of what to do with it, and SCULPTBODY helps you build that understanding. Some want pure numbers, and others want more guidance. SCULPTBODY does it all. Even if you've never heard the words 'stamina' before, SCULPTBODY helps you put that information to good use. Elite athletes and trainers do not fret! All the complex data you've been looking for is just as easily accessible through the app, and the server. Practice makes perfect, both for you, and for SCULPTBODY. SCULPTBODY increasingly adapts to your unique physiology after every use. Using your own biosignals as a baseline, SCULPTBODY helps you set goals that make sense for your sport and ability level. SCULPTBODY also learns from trends in the wider community. As more people use SCULPTBODY, the better SCULPTBODY will become at noticing small anomalies in your bio-signals as well as improper training patterns that could result in injury down the road.SCULPTBODY's app is designed to be simple, intuitive, and customizable. Our tile-based user interface allows you to easily drag and drop different metrics into place so you get exactly what you want on your home screen. You'll be able to view detailed figures, see elegant visualizations, and also get real-time recommendations and notifications. Users can track their workout progress, share achievements and do it all over again for any of the 152 muscles mapped with any of the 286 associated exercises. SCULPTBODY 3D was designed with multiple users in mind, making it ideal for sport instructors. Track your progress and stay motivated with our performance tracking tools. Use SCULPTBODY to see where you’ve gained or lost inches. Workout Progress shows you statistics on strength, endurance and calories burned for an entire workout, as well as individual exercises. As athletes, it’s difficult to access quality coaching wherever, whenever. By continuously tracking your movement, SCULPTBODY is your personal coach, guiding you towards optimal performance and precision in sports anytime, anywhere. By analyzing how your body moves, SCULPTBODY can help reduce your risk of injury and improve both your technique and performance in sport.Our dream is to help everyone utilize a scientific understanding of their body in their daily lives to improve their workout and maintain an active lifestyle while avoiding injury. It's time that everyone - not only the pros - have access to this type of bio-data and the guidance they need to use it effectively. Every contribution, no matter how small, brings this dream closer to reality. SCULPTBODY will revolutionize the sport wearable market in many ways. This is how we stack up to our competitors: The technology inside SCULPTBODY adds an incredible amount of context to your workout. Not only do you have a complete digital log of your specific exercises, SCULPTBODY enables you to see how your body is affected. You can see how rest affects each exercise, how quickly your heart recovers, the quality of your form and more. The SCULPTBODY platform builds on a community of data that will enable everyone to learn the different benefits of each exercise routine.SCULPTBODY senses your muscle activity using a technique that has been employed by clinicians and sports science professionals for decades called electromyography (EMG). EMG is the process of acquiring tiny electrical signals generated by muscle contractions at the surface of the skin. This technology has so far only been available to high-end athletes and professionals, but SCULPTBODY makes EMG easy to use by translating EMG signals into useful information. SCULPTBODY recognizes each unique muscle signature, determining what you're up to and whether you're doing it right. We will have an iPhone, Android and Desktop app  at launch. SCULPTBODY is in a lot better shape than 9 months ago, but we still need your help to get SCULPTBODY into your hands. Until now we've used external sensors and in the next 4 months we work to our beta prototype with sensors incorporated in textile material.You can see the great leaps SCULPTBODY has already taken to become in the next 4 months a working prototype.  All prototypes of our revolutionary sportswear are developed by our in-house engineering team. Together with our strong network of cooperation partners, such as experts in sensors, wiring and textile production, we have found the best solution for the SCULPTBODY device. You will have the option to evaluate your training history and improvements in results and vital date through the dedicated dashboard. Furthermore, we are working on integration of personal workout sessions with virtual coaches as well as customised workout plan with activity reminder function. We want to create a community, where you can interact with personal trainers and other athletes start competitions, share current/up to date information, the newest workouts or diets. Your contribution will go directly into building our beta units so that we can transform SCULPTBODY into a final product. But crowdfunding is not only about the funding, it is also about the crowd! Your contribution means a whole lot more than extra cash. Every contribution, no matter how small, will help us build the community we need to bring SCULPTBODY to life. Our first batch of production-quality SCULPTBODY will be delivered to early bakers in October 2016, and we are incredibly excited to see how it is received by the sport communitiy.

Along with your ideas we come up with concrete solutions that will help us change the world... SCULPTBODY is the first product being developed by Trust France, an Sophia Antipolis-based startup. If you'd like to get in touch with the team directly you can email contact@trustfr.comFor our full FAQ please click this link, as questions are asked during the campaign we will update this section with the most common. STAMINA:  SCULPTBODY help you to identify where your current performance limits are. So you'll know what you're really capable of. The key is good stamina usage control. SCULPTBODY gives you real-time stamina % readouts so you'll know the exact physiological load of any exertion intensity in different environmental conditions at any time. You can hence better decide whether to speed up, slow down, or take a break, and devise optimal strategies to train and compete. PERFORMANCE: SCULPTBODY keeps recods of your performance from sessions you choose to save and presents it in a clear-cut manner. From these records, you can see how far you've come and evaluate the effectiveness of a training plan or devise new training and strategies FORCE PLATE:  Measures forces generated while stepping or jumping SKIN TEMPERATURE: Measure subject temperature on surface of the skin VO2MAx: VO2 max is a measure of the maximum volume of oxygen that an athlete can use. It is measured in milliliters per kilogramme of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min). As you increase your effort when you exercise, the amount of oxygen you consume to produce energy (and hence the rate at which you exhale carbon dioxide) increases. However, there is a maximum level of oxygen consumption, beyond which increases in exercise intensity don’t lead to further increases in oxygen consumption. This level of oxygen consumption is called the VO2 max. Some experts believe that VO2 max is a key physiological determinant of an athlete’s running performance, and that it is an important objective of a training programme to improve it. SCULPTBODY provides an estimate of your VO2max. HAMSTRING: Hamstring injuries are common in athletes who participate in sports that require sprinting such as track, soccer, basketball and football. Hamstring strains account for 12-16 % of all injuries in athletes with re-injury rate reported as 22-34%. FIGHT AGAINST STRESS: Stress is part of everyone's life - non-athletes and athletes. Most persons generally associate stress with physical injuries. Everyone feels the pressure to succeed, pressure of failing, fear of injury, fear of reinjure, or anxiety about overcoming an injury. However, many individuals do not and will not recognize the symptoms. SCULPTBODY can be used to determine the nature of an person's response to training, particularly his/her capacity to tolerate training loads. Data are used to demonstrate the use of the inventory to determine: a) training responses which are either too stressed or under-stressed, b) the ideal amount of stress to promote the optimum level of training effort, c) the influence of outside-of-sport stresses that interfere with the training response, d) preliminary features of overtraining, e) reactions to jet-lag and travel fatigue, and vi) peaking responses.","TECHNOLOGY AND TESTINGThe SCULPTBODY Suit is a truly innovative breakthrough product combining different areas of expertise such as textiles and electronics engineering, wiring, software development and sport science.

Suicide is, unfortunately, a very serious problem that OG wants to help prevent as much as possible. He believes taking your own life does not end the chances of life getting worse, but it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting any better. Most hip-hop artists write about meaningless stuff to sell albums, but OG genuinely wants to help better the lives of everyone around him in any way possible.

Darnell Price became known as “O.G. Cuicide”, his contribution to music, movies and media was cultivated through his direct experience and relationships. O.G. was blessed to be part of this rich culture and be taught the business by legends in the industry. It is an amazing story that needs to be told.His very first song recorded in “a real studio”, was recorded with the late Mixmaster, Spade in 1987. From there he continued doing music and appearing in shows. O.G. began his exposure by being featured on: Living on the Edge of Insanity; The Life Album by Toddy Tee. The track was titled United We Stand Divided We Fall.As the pressure and exposure to a seemingly endless lifestyle high-impact and dangerous circumstances began to wear on O.G. he almost gave up! Around December 31, 1991 O.G survived a suicide attempt. By most people’s standards, this would have literally been it. By the grace of God, this could have easily been an echo of a story all too familiar in Compton during this time.Things began to change and positive influences took center stage for O.G. Not only does he send a positive message through his music, but now he also spends time speaking to help others understand that taking your own life does not end the chances of life getting worse, but it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting any better. He wants to help everyone he possibly can, and wants you to be a part of the journey. Enable OG Cuicide to provide a light in other people's lives.","There are many risks and challenges when attempting a speaking tour. Figuring out travel and lodging can sometimes be a mess, especially when traveling with staff.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/resourceco/resource-co?ref=discovery_category_newest,resourceco/resource-co,"Resource Co. is owned by founder Shane Swan, an analytical chemist who specializes in data analytics. We offer the service of connecting pawnshops. The product is a website that allows owners to buy and sell to each other. The focus starts with gold and diamond rings already owned by the pawnshops. These are high dollar products with comfortable margins. Resource Co. makes money by charging 10% per transaction. The objective of the business is to ensure that pawnshops no longer hold onto valuable goods without creating cash flow. The ability to move valuable products from one store to another will prove invaluable for the individual and franchise pawnshop owners. The data collected will allow for guaranteed income based on simple supply and demand for individual pawnshop owners, who collect goods at prices far below market value in their business model.This is important to me for a few reasons.1) Pawnshops are limited to their geographical location and digital business capabilities. They service their communities and therefore this limits low-income loan availability.2) Pawnshops operate their business in two segments: Pawn loans and selling pawned or sold items. Pawn loans are generally for lower-income individuals without established credit. This opens up the amount of money a pawn shop can now loan an individual because the sale of the item can be guaranteed by a buyer. This increases the number of loans a pawnshop can have at one time effectively increasing pawnshops' total revenue.3) Pawnshops are scattered collections of mini-warehouses and banks all in one. Each shop holds thousands of dollars of inventory and money is lost every minute the inventory sits idle.Personally, I was in a position where I had to use a pawnshop to survive. I made it to my last semester of college after losing my parents and guardians without taking on any loans. I had inherited a few pieces of gold and diamonds that I was able to hold on to while starving and bumming rides. I had problems with my financial aid package and had to pay parts of my tuition until the government could reimburse me. This created a multi-thousand dollar hole in the budget of a struggling pizza delivery driver. I was forced to sell some items and pawn my grandfather's ring. The market valued the ring around $4500. After trying all local pawnshops and traveling 50miles to New Orleans, I settled for a measly $700 loan. It was enough to get me by for the time I needed but it made me realize that so much money is left on the table. The pawnshops I would go to have literally pulled out drawers of rings to show me how saturated their supply was (some wouldn't even make an offer because of this).This is inefficient because so many different people are interested in these goods, particularly gold and diamonds. With time, the price of gold naturally increases. Every market scare or natural disaster creates people looking to buy gold but it's not easy. Resource Co. will allow for the expansion of the gold and diamond buy and sell market. Whether its the worried collector wanting bulk gold by the oz or someone trying to buy a cheap engagement ring with some flare, people are interested in gold and diamonds. It doesn't make any sense that these valuable goods sit for any amount of time so I hope I can convince some of you to help me make dollars because of it.","The scope of the project is quite sizeable. Some of the inherent challenges are customer acquisition, technical support for the product, trust for the purchase of large dollar amount items, and of course competition.Customer acquisition: The two main problems will be the why and the maintenance of products that are available. I propose the following, it only takes one shop in any given geographic location to sign up in order to gain access to that market. With every addition, thousands of dollars of wares can be made available to pawnshops in different locations to sell. It also only takes one sell to make someone stick with the product. We aim to create relationships between pawn shops that are lasting and mutually beneficial. Product maintenance will be time-consuming for the update of all the sales occurring. We are looking to build a way for sales to update real-time. This can only be tested as more users are acquired as we find the limits of the demo product. Technical support for the product: The bulk of the time spent outside of customer acquisition will be product maintenance and updates. The product is the most important and fluid piece of the entire project and will take the lion share of available time. This will ensure users have the best experience at any given time despite more users being added. Technical support will be as alive and responsive as humanly possible. Trust: The aim is to partner with the most reputable pawnshops in an area. These are naturally the ones who have better revenue in their stores. We can connect reputable, like-minded business owners to form the core network that allows for legitimately certified valuables to flow. We also plan to use a third party shipper like FedEx or US Postal and ship everything next day priority. This will limit the amount of liability assumed by Resource Co. and allow for pawnshops to feel more comfortable working together through shippers they know and trust.Competition: The risk of competition in any market is always palpable. Here, our main competitors offer products designed strictly for an individual business to increase their own sales. This means that the burden is placed on the individual pawnshop to sign up for all of the competitors' services for fees. Pawnshop owners have endless ways to try and sell their own items but there is no way to connect with guaranteed buyers. The competitors would cannibalize their own core products by fostering an attitude of cooperation instead of competition.

And it's well worth it!Replacing the old, broken windows will be around $800 and an additional $1000 for a cool and heating unit.A majority of the funds will be used for the lumber to build the separation wall between the class room and the wood shop. Also furniture build and the bathroom. We calculated that to be around $2400. An additional $400 for safety equipment for the children. And $1125 for the bathroom build.And we’ve budgeted $7800 to build a four season greenhouse so we can have farming classes year round.Each one of these projects will be an educational opportunity at Leddy's Homestead with students coming to learn hands-on, alongside professional craftspeople! Being able to taste fresh grown produce and take home a great memory to share with their family.We're going to need $25,000 to get this done and we're offering some amazing rewards!We appreciate your support, even if you can only spare a dollar.So please consider backing and spreading the word!THANK YOU!Follow us on Facebook:www.facebook.com/leddyshomesteador Instagram: www.instagram.com/leddyshomestead",A risk would be injury or unforseen issues within the old barn which would delay the planned date a few days or weeks. Another challenge would be miscalculation on our end which might force us to make light changes to the plan or design of the future education barn to stay within budget.

Thank You! I have big plans for my company GX Industries Inc. and our Mis-Fuel Prevention Adapter the GX. The goal we are driven and focused on hitting is to successfully get our product to the mass production level of injection molding. We are currently in the 3D printing stage with our adapter, normally this stage would suffice but we are committed to expanding and bringing the cost of our product down to better suit the transportation industry as a whole. The funds raised here will help us further that dream in being able to mass produce the adapter at a cost affordable price point. In order for us to accomplish this we need to move to the injection moldingstage of productdevelopment.The funds will also assist in further product development along with a more intense level of product testing. The funds will also play a vital role in marketing and retail, in turn with the right making push and retail optionwe can make the adapter a house hold name among the transportation industry.","The challenges that come along with this adapter is showing people that this issue really happens more often than normal. I had to get real data and numbers to prove the costly effects of putting gasoline into a diesel engine and explain why its important to prevent such an issue that may large companies face today. I met real difficulty in the early stage of devising a way to stop the gasoline nozzle from entering an opening that was significantly larger, all at the same time of allowing a diesel nozzle to pass through and block the smaller nozzle. The only real challenge I see moving forward is going to be the actual application in real world use of the adapter. The normal wear and tear and the abuse factor of it being used on a more frequent level. I plan to overcome this challenge by doing more product testing on the actual injection molded complete adapter.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gxadapter/device-that-stops-def-and-gasoline-from-entering-diesel-trucks?ref=discovery_category_newest,gxadapter/device-that-stops-def-and-gasoline-from-entering-diesel-trucks,"Here at Gx Industries Inc. we have created what we know will be game changing in the meduim/heavy duty trucking industry. We have created an adapter that prevents a gasoline and DEF nozzles from entering a diesel truck. Through 4 generations of the adapter we now have the 5th generation adapter finished, completed and tested. The goal for the 25k we are trying to raise will help us make a market push to make the device known among the trucking world, it will also allow us to travel to multiple truck trade shows while furthering our social media pressece. It will enable us to build a small inventory of adapters to have on hand while at trade shows or during vendor meetings.",The common risk we face is the lack of education. More education is needed on the maintenance side so that companies are aware that they don’t have to keep fixing this issue. They have the option to prevent it with our adapter.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/absolutelovesoda/healthy-carbonated-soda-medically-good-for-everyon?ref=discovery_category_newest,absolutelovesoda/healthy-carbonated-soda-medically-good-for-everyon,"Absolute Loveis a carbonated soda packed with key essential vitamins needed for the human body, activates over three hundred enzymes in the immune system, aids against the flu, strengthens DNA, strengthens bones, helps against anxiety, ADD, ADHD and more. This product contains Chromium, Magnesium, Vitamin D, Potassium, Vitamin B12 and Iron.Natural flavored, natural colored, gluten-free and does not contain the drug caffeine instead it comes with ginger root (Panax Ginseng) to promote the body to work with the vitamins to produce natural energy without the addiction of sugar nor the sugar crash of traditional sodas. Also, the product does not contain high fructose corn syrup or sugar fructose it is sweetened with the zero-calorie producing sweetener known as sucralose which made the product Splenda making this product good for everyone.Absolute Love's soda also comes in at 0 to 5 calories and has the good taste of traditional sodas except without contributing to diabetes, obesity, kidney stones, tooth decay or asthma like traditional sodas do. Product does not contain large sugar amounts and calories like the major soda makers products does.Vitamin Health Benefits:Vitamin B12:Benefits your mood, energy level, memory, heart, skin, hair, digestion and more. Vitamin B12 is also an essential vitamin for addressing adrenal fatigue, multiple metabolic functions — including enzyme production, DNA synthesis and hormonal balance — and maintaining healthy nervous and cardiovascular systems.Because of its wide-reaching roles within the body, a Vitamin B12 deficiency can show up in many different negative symptoms, many of which are very noticeable, such as potential chronic fatigue, mood disorders like depression, and chronic stress or feeling run down.Magnesium:A magnesium deficiency can cause significant symptoms. Some of the most prominent include:hypertension and cardiovascular diseasekidney and liver damageperoxynitrite damage that can lead to migraine headaches, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma or Alzheimer’s diseasenutrient deficiencies, including vitamin K, vitamin B1, calcium and potassiumrestless leg syndromeworsened PMS symptomsbehavioral disorders and mood swingsinsomnia and trouble sleepingosteoporosisrecurrent bacterial or fungal infections due to low levels of nitric oxide or a depressed immune systemtooth cavitiesmuscle weakness and crampsimpotenceeclampsia and preeclampsia.The body loses stores of Magnesium every day from normal functions, such as muscle movement, heartbeat and hormone production. Although we only need small amounts of Magnesium relative to other nutrients, we must regularly replenish our stores either from foods or magnesium supplements in order to prevent deficiency symptoms.Chromium:A metallic element that humans require in very small amounts. It is an essential part of metabolic processes that regulate blood sugar, and helps insulin transport glucose into cells, where it can be used for energy. Chromium also appears to be involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate, fat, and protein.Chromium enhances the actions of insulin and is necessary for maintaining normal metabolism and storage of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Inadequate intake of chromium has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance, a condition seen in type 2 diabetes. Chromium can also help raise HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, and may play a role in preventing heart disease.Vitamin D: ( The Sunshine Vitamin)Vitamin D is important for a number of reasons, including maintaining healthy bones and teeth; it may also protect against a range of conditions such as cancer, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.Vitamin D has multiple roles in the body, helping to:Maintain the health of bones and teeth.Support the health of the immune system, brain, and nervous system.Regulate insulin levels and aid diabetes management.Support lung function and cardiovascular health.Vitamin D is extremely important for regulating cell growth and for cell-to-cell communication. Some studies have suggested that calcitriol (the hormonally active form of vitamin D) can reduce cancer progression by slowing the growth and development of new blood vessels in cancerous tissue, increasing cancer cell death, and reducing cell proliferation and metastases. Vitamin D influences more than 200 human genes, which could be impaired when we do not have enough Vitamin D.Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, autism, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma severity, and swine flu, however more reliable studies are needed before these associations can be proven. Many of these benefits occur through Vitamin D's positive effect on the immune system.Potassium:Carries proven health benefits.It is an electrolyte that counteracts the effects of sodium, helping to maintain consistent blood pressure. Potassium is also important for maintaining the balance of acids and bases in the body. Bases are alkalis that have not yet dissolved in water.Blood pressure and cardiovascular health low potassium intake has repeatedly been linked with high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure, but ensuring a good intake of Potassium may be just as important.An increase in Potassium intake along with a decrease in sodium is crucial to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.Iron:Is an important component of hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to transport it throughout your body. Hemoglobin represents about two-thirds of the body’s iron. If you don't have enough iron, your body can't make enough healthy oxygen-carrying red blood cells. A lack of red blood cells is called iron deficiency anemia.Without healthy red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen. ""If you're not getting sufficient oxygen in the body, you're going to become fatigued,"" Thomas says. That exhaustion can affect everything from your brain function to your immune system's ability to fight off infections. If you're pregnant, severe iron deficiency may increase your baby's risk of being born too early, or smaller than normal.Iron has other important functions, too. ""Iron is also necessary to maintain healthy cells, skin, hair, and nails,"" says Elaine Chottiner, MD, clinical assistant professor and director of General Hematology Clinics at the University of Michigan Medical Center.Panax Ginseng:The active compounds in Panax Ginseng are believed to be steroid-like components called ginsenosides with health benefits going back to ancient times, Panax Ginseng was used to increase energy and stamina and to give the immune system a boost also erectile dysfunction, diabetes and cognition andimprove cognitive performance during prolonged periods of mental activity.Sucralose:Has the closest taste profile to sugar of all sweeteners, but 600x sweeter, the only non-nutritive sweetener made from sugar, perfect for use in low/no-calorie food, beverage, supplements.Long shelf life so sweet taste remains consistent over your product’s lifecycle, no additional cautionary labeling required – deemed safe, approved by the foremost food/beverage regulating authorities throughout the world, stable under a wide range of pH values-Great for products that are acidic in nature and highly soluble so mixes well in liquids-Soluble in ethanol for use in beverages containing alcohol.So,please back me in this endeavor to help start promoting good health and better soda for everyone.

Built in Sulkea in the Ganges region of India in 1853 by shipbuilderThomas Reeves, it has served as a troop transport, an immigrant and a cargoship.With alength of 48 m and beam of 9, she is the world’s oldest survivingmerchant ship and the only surviving ship that transported convicts toAustralia and settlers to Australia and New Zealand. She is now dry-docked atthe Edwin Fox Maritime Museum at Picton in New Zealand.Someinteresting facts:On her maiden voyage from India to the UK shecarried 10 passengers and general cargo.In 1854 shewas commandeered as troop transport for the Crimean War and on her first voyageshe carried 15 officers and 481 men from Calais (after being waved off byNapoleon) to Bomarsund in the Baltic Sea. (Florence Nightingale likely was apassenger on one return trip) After several voyages at the end of the war shewas re-fitted to carry general cargo and passengers in 1856.On 11 August1858 the Fox left Gravesend with 280 prisoners and 67 Prison Guards (with theirfamilies) onboard and arrived at the Swan River in Australia on 22 November with theaddition of 3 babies born to wives of the guards.On 14February 1860 she set sail from for Bombay from London with a general cargowhich included a substantial quantity of Taylor Walker's India Pale Ale.Several alcohol laden voyages followed earning her the nick name ""BoozeBarge""The firstmigrants to New Zealand on the Fox embarked at the Blackwall Depot in London on25 January 1873. 95 Passengers were bound for Otago and a similar number forCanterbury. After experiencing a severe storm she ended up in Brest on the 5February. 23 of the passengers decided they had enough and the after repairsthe Fox cleared Brest on 5 March 1873 and arrived in Lyttleton Harbour on 27June 1873.The adventof steam powered vessels brought an end to the era of trade by sailing ships and the Fox underwent a major refit in London to convert her to a refrigerationvessel. Her last voyage under her own power started 25 June 1885 when she leftLondon for Otago where she arrived 17 October 1885. After serving in many portsas a refrigeration vessel she was finally towed to Picton in January 1897 whereshe served in this role until June 1900. During this period she broke a recordby freezing 12000 carcasses (to be exported to London) in 43 days.The Fox lashed to a steamer unloading frozen carcasses.Thecompletion of a freezing works just west of Picton saw the Fox being strippedof the refrigeration plant and turned into a coal hulk to store coal for thenew freezing works.. She served in this role for the next 50 years and wasfinally de-registered on 29 October 1953.The EdwinFox Restoration Society was formed in May 1965. Their initial campaign to havethe vessel restored ultimately failed but they were the driving force behind alocal effort to have her cleaned out, re-floated and finally towed toShakespeare Bay where she remained for 19 years and was effectivelyshipwrecked.In 1980,volunteers managed to re-float and tow her into Picton Harbour where a mooringwas found.The currentEdwin Fox museum was opened in 1990 facilitated by grants of $50 000 from boththe NZ Government as well as the Picton Pakeke Lions. In 1993 the centre won anaward for Historic/Cultural/Arts and Crafts Visitor attraction and attracts around10 000 visitors a year.All effortsto rebuild the vessel eventually petered out and there was concern that shewould not stay afloat indefinitely. On the 18 May1999 the Edwin Fox was pushedinto a custom built dry-dock with financial assistance from various sources suchas The Lotteries Board,Marlborough District Council, Canterbury CommunityTrust, Port Marlborough and the Picton Lions.Costley,N.

As an added bonus the models are stored offpremises and can easily be made available to any number of interested parties.The benefits of 3D modelling include:§ Being able toreplicate objects through 3D printing or even traditional model building.§ Allowing highaccuracy measurements to be made directly on the model.§ Comparingobjects of similar nature easily.§ As anon-contact, non-invasive technology with extremely low risk of damage toobjects.§ Offering an exciting visual impact that cangreatly enhance the learning experience of students and create more publicawareness.§ Enablingmuseums to give public visual access to artefacts not on display for reasonsrelated to security, fragility, lack of space, etc.§ Allowing thecustodian or owner of the object to retain full control over access to models.§ Allowingresearchers the potential of risk-free access to material of interest on aglobal scaleNew Zealand straddles the Australian and Pacifictectonic plates and as a result experiences frequent earthquakes. The mostrecent of significance struck the top of the South Island (Kaikoura on Nov 14 2016) and caused considerabledamage to infrastructure. The ferry terminal in Picton (about 100m away fromthe Edwin Fox Museum) suffered minor damage during this quake and caused minordisruption to the Ferry services. The Edwin Fox faces a very real risk of beingseverely damaged in the occurrence of a major event.Photo credit Geoff LangThe seabed lifted by about a meter in Kaikouraafter the earthquake. Should this happen in Picton the Edwin Fox is likely totopple from her props and suffer extensive damage.On 17 &18 December 2016 the team from 3D Scans scanned the Edwin Fox as well ascertain items on display in the museum.The team used aFaro Scene Laser Scanner to capture around 48 scans as well as Nikon D3S, NikonD800 and Nikon 7200 cameras to take just over 7700 high resolution photographs.Point cloud generation was done separately for the interior, exterior and looseparts using both scans as well as photographs in Reality Capture software. Theraw data created in Reality Capture software for both interior and exterior of thevessel consists of more than 380million polygonseach.The point cloud data was converted to polygonal meshes, which has undergone preliminary clean-up and were assembled to create one data set for both interior as well as exterior of the vessel.Polygonal meshes assembled in Zbrush software to form exterior of the vessel.The current work involves further cleaning up, removing unwanted objects and restoring obscured portions of the polygonal meshes.Work in progress for cleaning up the interior of the vessel.The top image shows initial cleaning up competed whilst the bottom one shows the same segment after restoration.As the cleaning up and restoration process is finalised, the model will be textured and optimised for being uploaded and viewed online on a 3D platform from either personal computers or smartphones. The ultimate goal in the restoration process is to digitally preserve all the original timber of the vessel in a highly detailed model which will potentially be available for anyone to enjoy and explore online from any part of the wolrd.Any funds received in excess of our project goal will beapplied towards completion of the next stages which are:A fulldigital reconstruction of the vessel to one of its original sailing states, acinematic sequence and a VR experience.All themodels created as well as the raw data will eventually be the property of theEdwin Fox Society.We havecontributed about NZ$10 000 and more than 500 man hours to date and really needyour support to bring this project to fruition.",Risks and challengesThe vessel was scanned in December 2016 resulting in high quality digital data collected. Approximately 40% of the work has already been done to complete the model and the only risk to completion on due date would be if something happens to our CGI Artist. Some of the awards are 3D printed by specialists from our data and there could be minor production delays affecting delivery times of these awards.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/217163910/creating-a-3d-model-of-edwin-fox-a-very-old-mercha?ref=discovery_category_newest,217163910/creating-a-3d-model-of-edwin-fox-a-very-old-mercha,"3D modelling is the ideal technique for safeguarding important artefacts. We can preserve their external visual appearance and accurate dimensions, allowing for reconstruction through both traditional and high tech methods. The possibilities for collaboration, re-creation and advanced study are limitless. Artefacts can be recreated for display around the world while being kept safe in storage. Students can see and explore items in greater detail than they would from behind a glass barrier. Creators can return items to life through digital re-enactment. The potential to deepen our understanding of the past is limitless, and your donation will be part of making that happen!We are using cutting-edge technology to literally turn back the clock of time for the Edwin Fox, the oldest surviving merchant ship that transported both passengers and cargo throughout the world.On the 16th December 2016 the 3D Scans team effectively shielded the Edwin Fox from the ravages of time by completing a 3 dimensional digital scan of the vessel using laser scanning supplemented by over 7700 digital photographs.We now need your help to complete this process by creating a digital alter-ego of the vessel using the above data.We have contributed in excess of 10 000 NZ$ and 600 man hours to date and the creation of a very high resolution digital 3D model is about halfway to completion.For detailed images of progress to date please see our video above.Our extended goal is to actually turn back the clock by digitally restoring the vessel to its original sailing state using state of the art CGI, VFX and VR techniques.With every passing year, the world’s physical history is decaying. Museums around the world strive to preserve the past, but they can only do so much. By digitally preserving the Edwin Fox, we aim to demonstrate how today’s cutting edge technology is an essential tool for preserving, restoring and studying the rich relics of human history,After being abandoned and almost lost to the elements, an epic effort saved the physical remains of the vessel, but it is again at risk, this time by natural disaster in the form of a devastating earthquake. It is ironic that she survived all the mighty ocean forces unleashed on her and the subsequent neglect only to be once more threatened in her final resting place.Our ultimate goal is to build the capacity within New Zealand to provide a comprehensive scanning service to museums and other institutions in this country. The ambition is to establish New Zealand as a world player in this practice, and build a specialised industry around it. However, the first step is the successful completion of the Edwin Fox preservation project, which relies on the help of generous donors such as yourself.A few links to interesting articles relating to the use of 3D models in heritage preservation follows at the end.Currently in dry dock at the Edwin Fox Maritime Museum at Picton, New Zealand, the Edwin Fox is a vessel of great international cultural and historical value. 48 metres long, with a 9 metre beam, she has played a role in significant international events. The sturdy vessel plied the seas for decades and worked tirelessly, before being abandoned to a slow demise.Originally launched from Sulkea, India in 1853 by shipbuilder Thomas Reeves, her maiden voyage with 10 passengers and general cargo was to England.In 1854 she was commandeered as a troop transport for the Crimean War. On her first troop voyage, after being waved off by Napoleon Bonaparte, she carried 15 officers and 481 men from Calais to Bomarsund in the Baltic Sea. It was on one of her return voyages in this conflict that the Edwin Fox likely carried the Lady with the Lamp herself, Florence Nightingale.Following the war, she was refitted to carry general cargo and passengers in 1856.The Edwin Fox is the only surviving ship that transported convicts to Australia and settlers to Australia and New Zealand.Records show she left Gravesend, England, on 11 August 1858 bound for Australia. She carried 280 prisoners, 67 prison guards and their families and, upon arrival at the Swan River in Australia on 22 November, she had added 3 babies, born to wives of the guards.She was also at times known as a ‘booze barge’. On 14 February 1860 she set sail from London, carrying a general cargo to Bombay which included a substantial quantity of Taylor Walker's India Pale Ale.Later in life, she carried early migrants to New Zealand. The Edwin Fox departed London’s Blackwall Depot on 25 January 1873 with 95 passengers bound for Otago and a similar number bound for Canterbury. A severe storm forced her to lay over in Brest, France, where 23 passengers decided they were done with ocean travel. She eventually arrived in Lyttelton Harbour on 27 June 1873.With the advent of steam and the decline of sail, the Edwin Fox was converted to a refrigeration vessel in London. From 1885 she served in many ports as a refrigeration vessel before she was finally towed to Picton in January 1897. Here she served for 3 years, setting a new record by freezing 12000 export carcasses in 43 days.Upon the completion of a freezing works just west of Picton, she was stripped of the refrigeration plant and turned into a coal hulk to store coal for the new works. She served in this role for the next 50 years and was finally de-registered on 29 October 1953.The Edwin Fox Restoration Society was formed in May 1965. Their initial campaign to have the vessel restored ultimately failed but they were the driving force behind a local effort to have her cleaned out, re-floated and finally towed to Shakespeare Bay where she remained for 19 years and was effectively shipwrecked.In 1980, volunteers managed to re-float and tow her into Picton Harbour where a mooring was found. The current Edwin Fox Museum was opened in 1990 facilitated by grants of $50 000 from both the NZ Government as well as the Picton Pakeke Lions. In 1993 the centre won an award for Historic/Cultural/Arts and Crafts Visitor attraction and attracts around 10 000 visitors a year. More recently the Museum has won the World Ship Trust Award and been highly commended in the Westpac Marlborough Chamber of Commerce 'Adding Value to Marlborough’ Award. It also received a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellenceevery year since 2012.All efforts to rebuild the vessel eventually petered out and there was concern that she would not stay afloat indefinitely. On the 18 May 1999 the Edwin Fox was pushed into a custom built dry-dock with financial assistance from various sources such as The Lotteries Board, Marlborough District Council, Canterbury Community Trust, Port Marlborough and the Picton Lions.Want to help us?

QVC has invited me to showcase and sell my brittleinthe Spring. BUT,there is one thing that stands in our way-$25,000 to produce and retain akitchen space.I openedNatasha’s Just Brittle @ Bel-Garden Bi-Rite Supermarket on May 1, 2016.Fourmonths later, and after 21 years in the childcare industry, I decided toclose my own childcare business to focus on Natasha’s Just Brittle fulltime.Just 3 days after I took that leap of faith, QVC called me to dobusiness. I had questioned how I would make it happen, but then I got right towork taking steps towards this venture. And, I need your help.Help UsKickStart and You Can Savor a Piece of the Business. Needed. With everydonation of $25 or more, we will send you a gift. Thank you so much forbelieving in Natasha’s Just Brittle.Be sure to scroll down tolook at our rewards and stretch goals.What’s not to love abouthomemade peanut brittle? Since the age of 12, I loved creating sweet treats andalways knew that I would own my own business.In 1996 I entered the childcare industry. I always believe that if yougive a child the basic tools that they need to learn, they can take thosetools and soar. I also believe that their physical environment should behealthy and clean without toxins that would enable them to learn and thrive. Therefore Progress Place Learning Center/Where children grow, learn and play transitioned into an Ecofriendly childcare facility. We cared for 20 children ages 6 weeks – 12 years. I had a curriculum that incorporated math,language, sensory, arts and crafts, computer and cooking activities. Every week my daycare children would takepart in creating their own snack or meal.We even put in a garden which was a little challenging because I live inBaltimore City. The children enjoyedpicking their own vegetables and incorporating them in our meals. During thesummer months at PPLC the children got a little break from learning activitiesandhad a chanceto enjoy a summertaking field trips around the city. The summer of 2009,my staff and I wantedto expose our toddlers ages 2 -5 to a fun filled summer. We decided that our children ages 6- 12 wouldgo to summer camp. Well some of those children opted out of going to summercamp and chose to spend their time at the daycare center. I had to create an activity thatwould keep their minds active and decided to give them a lesson in business fundamentals. We opened a sweet shop called PPLC Sweet Treats selling cakes,cookies, smoothies, brownies and brittle. I knew that a second business was in the worksespecially when the first thing my daycare parents would ask in the morningwas, “Do you have any more of that brittle."" In December of 2009, Natasha’s JustBrittle online store was born! Natasha’s Just Brittle is slowly cooked with allnatural fresh ingredients, including a secret blending of organic sugar, saltedbutter, fresh nuts, sea salt and agave. My recipe does not incorporate cornsyrup like most brittles and has no preservatives, artificial coloring orflavoring. Made in over 30 traditional & nut free flavors, each brittle has itsown unique recipe blending different extracts and spices to get the mostflavors from the nut that is used. http://www.biritesupermarket.com/http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/01/13/the-brittle-queen-of-baltimore-takes-on-queen-boss/Check out the show ""Queen Boss"" on demand.

Natasha’s Just Brittle was conceived in summer 2009 as part of a businessfundamentals learning project for the children at her daycare. PPLC SweetTreats, the daycare’s made-to-order sweet shop, sold over $500 in confectionsthat summer. The brittle was the most popular item and was in high demand fromparents long after, sparking the creation of Natasha’s Just Brittle. Today,five of the children who took part in the original project work for thecompany. Since 2009, Natasha has opened a website and a storefrontat Bel-Garden Bi-Rite Supermarket in Baltimore and is a mainstay atBaltimore-area local business pop-up shops. In August 2016, Natasha closed herdaycare after 21 years to focus full-time on her company. Three days afterclosing the doors on her life’s work up until then, Natasha received a callinquiring if she would sell her brittle on QVC. The first order was a hugesuccess, quickly selling out. In May 2017, the company closed its Bel-Garden Bi-RiteSupermarket storefront and moved to a full-size commercial kitchen, that has the capacity to increase production seven times more than before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHbirQiSCuAIn February 2017, Natasha appeared as one of 18 finalists,selected from over 1000 contestants, on Centric TV’s Queen Boss, a televisionseries competition that features fast-rising female entrepreneurs pitchingtheir products and company to a judges’ panel for a $25,000 prize.

Since 2006 I have been grilling for my family here in Marietta, GA and creating my own sauces. I moved from Somerset, NJ where I was born and raised to follow my career in Network Engineering for Cingular Wireless and I use to grill there in my mothers backyard, For Mom, friends and family from time to time, to enjoy each others company. My mom - is mom, a friend and game rival she is and was never anyone to be pushed around but she loved 101% of the time. Her maiden name is Briggs. She always encouraged me to follow my gut. So that's how I got the name Briggs.. Now, my girlfriend Crystal and I would talk about what I would like to do in the future and I would always talk about putting my bbq sauce on the market to share.Late 2006 - 2007, I began grilling for my co-workers in Atlanta, GA and saving my money to purchase my first Treager Grill, grilling in front of Oscar's on Terrell Mill Rd on the side. The owner Jay and I were and still are good friends. We talk about sauce combinations and how we can drive more business and community unity. It was a great way to get the opinion from people about my sauce.2011 - I married my beautiful wife Crystal, she obtained her Bachelors in 2012, Had our son Jay Jr, and got her Masters Degree in 2014. During that time I developed a low carb line which I have not introduced yet and worked long hours praying to god my sauce business would be a success when I start it. 2016 - The Business was started, I obtained my Bachelors degree and I made Crystal the CEO of Briggs Barbecue Sauces LLC. We have been selling on Amazon, Face to Face, Online, and in local mom and pop stores here in Atlanta, GA. With the help of our Customers, Family and God we are growing faster everyday! We made our son J Jr  the logo of our family creation. He loves the original on his french fries.2016 - We started donating our bottles during the thanksgiving season to companies like The Goddard School of Smyrna's Charities for their gift baskets to raise money. I know god gave us this sauce to help others any way we can. We are talking to more charities as well.  Thanks for coming by and let us know if you need us Briggsbarbecuesauce@gmail.com","We are challenged with the need for capitol for opening an office and storage location, Hire people to raise more funds and create more lines of sauces.

I would call them Steph’s Scrappy Rolls which is myversion of the popular jelly roll. JellyRolls typically consist of 40-42 strips of 2 ½ inch wide fabric and are greatfor those who are new to quilting, however, they tend to cost upwards of $25.00and I think this discourages those who would like to attempt quilting, but who don’twant, or have the time, to cut a bunch of fabric.Understanding this and seeing how cutting fabric by hand isslow, tedious, and can make your wrists and elbows start hurting after a fewhours of cutting, we have determined that a fabric cutter is needed.I would like to purchase a fabric cutter and dies to begin producing our Scrappy Rolls.I would like to offer our scappy rolls at a more reasonable price.","This is a low risk endeavor.  I have been quilting since 1985 when my grandmother signed me up to take a machine quilting class.   I have been quilting for a very long time and have a lot of experience that I can use to teach others to enjoy this craft.  The machine that we need will allow us to cut fabric faster and get our Scrappy Rolls out to the quilt guilds and sewing groups more timely and allow us to start generating revenue to open our shop.The challenges we will be facing are the financial aspects of starting up a new business, however there is a huge following in our area of the quilting art.  I have found over 10 quilt guilds alone in our area who would be thrilled with a better price point for our Scrappy Rolls!  I also already have contacts at each of the guilds which will equate to free advertising and generate the income needed to continue making our Scrappy Rolls.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/63091179/quilter-needed?ref=discovery_category_newest,63091179/quilter-needed,My daughter and I are quilt makers and would love to startour own fabric shop.One of the servicesthat we would like to offer in our shop is the ability to quilt your own tops orfor us to quilt them for you.Our current machine is worn out and we wouldlike to purchase a new one that will produce a better quality product that wecan currently offer.We would like to share our experience and love of the art ofquilting with our community and will offer time slots to learn how to quilt andslots for those who would like to do the quilting themselves. I have not been able to find another shop who offers thisservice in the Greater OKC area and would like to be the first!,"This is a low risk endeavor as the art of quilting is very popular in our area with approximately 10 active quilt guilds and more people learning the art of quilting every day.    The challenges that we will face will be having enough time available for everyone to be able to utilize this service.  Once we get this service off of the ground, it may be necessary to purchase a second and maybe  a third quilting machine."

The idea was to make it as cheap as possible to be able to place some of them into any room where currently standard switches for light, blinds etc. are placed.The design is based on a WeMos D1 mini board with an ESP-8266EX processor and WiFi. The embedded processor board is connected with some additional glue logic to a 128x160 (WxH) pixel full colour TFT touch screen. The display is placed into a plastic casing that is designed to fit into 55mm switch series, such as the ones from JUNG (e.g. AS500) or from Gira. The following picture shows how the smart touch switch will fit into a standard home wall switch series for perfect integration. This is the prototype that now runs for a couple of weeks in my own house:The main features of the hardware are:The following pictures show the construction of the smart touch switch:The display is directly embedded into the plastic front, which is only 1-2mm thick so that it looks like a homogeneous panel. On the backside of the panel sits the custom PCB for the glue logic, power control and touch screen controller. On top of that is stacked the WeMos D1 mini board. In total, the overall depth is ~20mm, so that it easily fits into standard switch holes and that there is enough place for the power supply cables.The plastic cover is currently made using a 3D printer. For the final product, the idea is to use injection molding for small series, as the resulting part is more durable and cheaper for higher volumes.Side remark: the wires on the pictures are there only for the prototype, as I have made some modifications after the first batch of prototype PCBs have been created. The final design will not have those wires, of course. Currently, the design is made for a supply voltage of 5..28V. E.g., if you already have a KNX cabling in your house, it will be easy to use two of the wires in the KNX cable for powering the smart switches, so that you can replace simple switches by the smart touch displays.There is a plan to build the device with a power supply option for 230V as well, so that it will fit into any switch outlet (especially for existing infrastructures). However most of the times you would need a relais too for controlling the light or shutter that has been originally controlled by the switch. Furthermore, the separation of the different power levels require a more complex design, so that this extension is on the roadmap for next year. If you are interested in the 230V product, you can already preorder some of them for a discounted price (the final price will be somewhere around 99€). If the demand is very high, the first batch could be produced earlier than the currently estimated date of April 2018.For the software the plan is to support two different options:The following picture shows an early prototype screen of the App, that will be available to control the smart switch functionality:I have created a short video to show the current prototype functionality (see gallery). The use case I have implemented is turning on/off the light in our living room by using the smart switch. The communication is shown in the following diagram:The touch switch publishes an MQTT message to the corresponding topic via WLAN to an MQTT broker (in my case mosquitto running on a raspberry pi). A home controller (in my case Fhem also running on a raspberry pi) acts as gateway between MQTT and KNX. The home controller listens on events for the living room light and forwards the ON/OFF commands to the KNX actor, that then turns on/off the light.After successful funding I will directly start with selecting a suitable make-to-order manufactorer to build the current batch of devices. I already have some of them on my shortlist, so ideally, the devices can be delivered before Christmas this year ;-) ","As there is already a working prototype, the general feasibility of the project has been proven. However, there can still go something wrong during contract production with poor PCB and / or soldering quality. Also the assembly of the product can result in unforseen issues, e.g., braking screw connections.Furthermore, the App for programming the devices has the risk that it will not be finished until Christmas, however things are looking good currently. But the SDK will be definitively ready (as it mostly currently already is for the working prototype).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/159751026/23-smarthome-touch-display-w-wlan-for-55mm-switch-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,159751026/23-smarthome-touch-display-w-wlan-for-55mm-switch-series,"I have developed a smart touch switch that fits into 55mm standard switch series used in many houses and buildings. The original idea was to make it as cheap as possible to be able to place some of them into any room where currently standard switches for light, blinds etc. are placed. Furthermore it should be flexible to display pictures and text. My first prototype was done in 2017 and since then I have improved the design implementing the most important requirements based on user feedback.The new design is based on the well known ESP32 processor with WiFi and now has a much larger (compared to the first design) 2,3 colour TFT with capacitative touch and a size of 320x240 pixel. The display is placed into a plastic casing that is designed to fit into most of the 55mm switch series.The following picture shows how the smart touch switch will fit into a standard home wall switch series for perfect integration.The main features of the hardware are:The following pictures show the construction of the smart touch switch:The display is directly embedded into the plastic front, which is only 1-2mm thick so that it looks like a homogeneous panel.

E.g., if you already have a KNX cabling in your house, it will be easy to use two of the wires in the KNX cable for powering the smart switches, so that you can replace simple switches by the smart touch displays.However, as most of the existing installations do not have this option, I have developed a 230V adapter that also includes a relais, so that you can replace an existing regular switch by this Touch Display Switch. The adapter mainly consists of a switching power supply and the relais on a PCB that is placed into a plastic housing that fits into the switch outlet.This is a prototype of the plastic case that shows how the final product will be mounted into the wall socket:The touch display is the just simply sticked into the pin header.For the software there a multiple options:1. There is a cool project out there on GitHub called Homepoint, which is a MQTT display controller for the ESP32. The configuration is done with a JSON file. The screen is divided into multiple regions, that can be filled with icons and text.I have created a fork of this project and made it run in my SmartHome touch controller. The pictures and the video are based on this software. This is fully functional.I am currently working on a web application that can be used to graphically place the elements and which generates the JSON file.2. As it is a ESP32, there are a lot of libraries out there that can be used to develop own interfaces. I have created forks of GUIslice and TFT_eSPI that can be used as starting point.The PCB layouts are final and ready for production. For the touch controller board with the ESP32 I have already made a pre-production run with 5 PCBs produced by an external manufactoring company. The prototype showed in the pictures is made with these boards. So, ramping up production for this part should be straight forward.One of the things that will need some additional effort is creating the final plastic cover for the 230V module and finding production partners for producing these parts. After successful funding, I would calculate 2-3 months for finishing this task.","As there is already a working prototype, the general feasibility of the project has been proven.However, there can still go something wrong during contract production with poor PCB and / or soldering quality.

Behind the excellent creative team which includes two top Hollywood Producers, it is a a stellar UK and US ensemble cast that includes Hollywood legend Burt Reynolds, Bai Ling, Adam Garcia, Jane March, Nazneen Contractor (24, Star Trek into Darkness), Carmen Electra, Martin Kemp, Sofya Skya (Assassins Run with Christian Slater and ex Mrs World), Kate Ashfield, (Shaun of the Dead) Jonathan Cake(Desperate Housewives), Douggie Henshall, Sean Maguire, Elizabeth Berrington (In Bruges) and other well known faces plus top Comedy Director Jonathan Gershfield.

We have a unique opportunity to tell this story at a time when there will be a particular focus on Irish history as the Irish Easter Rising of 1916 will be commemorating it's centenary next year.Not only will the film give an insight into what the Irish people went through during the famine, but it also celebrates the compassion and humanity that was shown to the Irish by the Ottoman Empire during 1847 when aid was sent. However, the film is not only a historical piece- but also a love story/drama and can be compared to films such as Braveheart, Schindler's List, Titanic and Pearl Harbour.What do we need finance for?We are currently raising development finance in order to be able to package the film. The script and story will attract a well known cast however it's imperative to first secure a well-known Director, Casting Director and Line Producer.  Once we have the Director and cast in place we will secure a top global Sales Agent to  ensure global cinematic distribution and pre-sales. Pre-production will begin, i.e setting up a shoot schedule, bringing a location manager on board and so on. We intend to release the film in late 2016. We will use £15,000 to initially secure a top Casting Director, £5,000 for fees to attach the Line Producer who will itemise the budget from the script and create the shoot schedule including scene breakdowns and £5,000 to cover initial fees for legal and accounting to structure the companies UK and Irish to maximise the tax breaks and to ensure the share offer prospectuses are legally accurate and create all legal contracts.What is special about this project?The reason this film project is special and unique is that it is a hugely moving and sensitive story based on true historical events that have affected generations of people in Great Britain and around the world particularly the USA and Canada. It shows one of the first acts of Global Charity, a Muslim nation helping a non-Muslim nation and political policies being enforced that caused pain and suffering to millions. Like many epics before it will be a great educator to those who are not familar with the history and for future generations. ","Making a film always comes with various risks and challenges, especially as we are an independent film company who are trying to make a film of this magnitude. For a film like this the  biggest obstacle  is putting the package together that attracts large film investors and financiers. This requires initial funding. Once that is secured and the component parts are in place the project will attract larger investment and funding from sources we already have great relationships with.Filming itself can always present challenges. We will be working with the most expereinced filmakers who will have encountered every conceivable problem unlike a film with less experienced people. Many films will have challenges when it comes to securing a theatrical release and raising funds for marketing and publicity. We are 'piggy backing' the wave of publicity that will be about Ireland next year. Around 22 million euros are being spent by the Irish Government next year to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising. We are also donating a substantial sum of the profits to the NSPCC and will be working closely with them and their celebrity supporters to promote the film at fundraising events.From previous films our Producers have worked on we already have  great relationships with  agents so we  are confident that when the finance is in place we will be able to secure a cast that will attract a global audience. Most of the films of this genre have between one and three A List actors with a good supporting cast and that is enought to carry the film withiout a huge budget. We expect that the top Irish actors will wish to be involved in a film that depicts such significant events about their own heritage.We have lined up some of the best CGI people the industry has at a fraction of the cost due to the nature of the film and it's likely prominence at the box office. We are maximising  tax incentives offered by HMRC and Irish Film Board to maximise profits for investors and mitigate risk. A detailed recoupment plan is in place and the Producers, with their extensive financial background , will ensure the  project in brought in on budget and with profit in mind  for Investors and the charity."

And we will be there to help with instruction and to help everyone enjoy themselves.We have pre- package DIY sets boxed up and ready to take anywhere. Want to paint at home with your best friend, or want a special project to do with your daughter? We have got you covered. Pick up advanced kits as well, which will contain rhinestones, glue and tools used to apply your own rhinestones after painting your glass. Instructions for baking the glasses will be included as well.We also sell completed glasses and take custom orders for weddings, birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. Want a present for a friend and don't know what to get them? Custom them their own personal glass. We will be offering wine glasses in several sizes and styles, beer mugs, coffee mugs, martini glasses, champagne glasses, pint glasses, shot glasses, whiskey glasses, candle holders, plates, Christmas ornaments and more.","One of the major challenge for my company will be finding and training the right people to help with reproduction. I paint a certain way on the glass and need it to look the same. Of course with hand painting not one glass will EVER be alike, which makes us very unique, but the same techniques need to be used. We will never use stickers or transfers. The finished work ad custom glassware we create for customers will 100% be hand painted every time. The people hired and trained will also need to have a creative mind to recreate a customers dream onto a glass. This is be the biggest challenge, but as a company who offers parties, we also meet a lot of people and get to see their work upfront first hand.  This issue will only apply to completed products. The pre packaged DIY sets will not need specialty work. We also have many outlets for future hires, art places, colleges, art majors, crafts shows, our classes, and many more. So it will take special care, but it wont be impossible. A risk for us can be that we get great response, which would mean some of our projects might get delayed, because everything we produce for rewards will be hand done. We will over come this by hiring more people and ordering more in bulk once funded.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1097644365/clinkers-clink?ref=discovery_category_newest,1097644365/clinkers-clink,"We are ready to start expanding. We want to inspire more people and to make more jobs for artists. We want to use the funds raised to purchase the machine needed to start mass producing some designs that our artists have created for our company. We then will expand and each artist will have their own line of glassware designs that we can use for all of our glassware. By mass producing our glassware, we will be more affordable for all , while still maintaining the option to have the custom hand painted glassware as well. By raising thiscapital we want to support our growth as well as give local artists a way to make extra money on the sideandallow them a way to make money doing what they love. ","We have already over come most of the risk. Now it is just working with the graphic side of printing the designs as they are painted originally. this will just take time and a few practice runs. If we do however come up against a huge problem, we will evaluate it from there and do what we need to do to overcome it."

Or for the gardening enthusiasts, you plant a dozen herbs and when they start growing you don't remember which one was which?Here to solve both sets of problems, and do it in a bright and colourful way, I am going to develop a range of garden themed art and sign pieces to help you pick the right herb, remember which plot had what in it, or just have a novelty saying to brighten your outdoor setting.My goal is to combine the cost efficiency of mass production with the variability of personal choice, and produce a high quality, durable product that will stand the test of time, and is tailored to suit your tastes and needs, all at a fair and reasonable price. If you've ever tried to get a single personalised item made, you can appreciate the costs can be rather staggering.","The risks and challenges I believe I will face in getting this concept off the ground are fairly minimal, but do exist in the form of selecting the correct medium and coating that will be durable for being in the garden and weathering the test of the elements and not warping, cracking or fading and is a 'buy once only' item.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/723520661/timber-coffee-tables-in-3d?ref=discovery_category_newest,723520661/timber-coffee-tables-in-3d,"Hourigan Designs is an emerging, premium timber craft and design workshop offering high quality works at affordable prices.Ever wanted furniture that was more interesting than a flat pack DIY?

You get to choose your design inlay, Jarrah or Spotted Gum timber top and frame fully assembled ready to go. Each top will have an inlaid piece of glass (not shown) ensuring the table can be used as exactly that.The table top measures 60 cm wide by 90 cm long, and will stand 40 cm high, the perfect size and height for a living room.Designing the concept.A well built table becomes an investment in your home and living space, and with people craving new and interesting concepts all the time, we felt that carved 3D table tops might appeal to a select clientèle.Using a variety of timber types and mediums, including Bamboo ply for those interested in renewable products, we have thoroughly tested our ability to create visually appealing 3 dimensional models in a timely and affordable manner.So why tables?Whether it's at a little boutique cafe in an out of the way alley, where you sit and enjoy your favourite hot beverage, the local beer garden where tales are exchanged, or even family dinner, the table is and has always been a centre point of conversation. So why not make the table a part of the conversation? Not in the literal sense; ""Hello Table, how are you today?"" Of course, you are free to talk to your new carved table if you so desire, but we meant that creating a central feature that catches peoples eye and becomes a talking point.So in our quest to create new and exciting furniture, the coffee table appealed as a sensible starting point to test the market for this novel idea. If the interest is there, we have plans to expand capability and move into bench tops, dining tables, doors and decorative panels, all aimed at breathing warmth and character into your home with the beauty of natural timber and decorative designs.Timeline for creation and shipping of finished tables.More design options.These models are available in either timber type, and can be dished, as seen in the Flower Maiden example above, or faux hand carved, as seen in the Howling Wolf example below.Are these the only design options?Certainly not, we have permission to utilise a vast library of 3D clipart, with more designs becoming available all the time. So if you don't see any table designs you like, we feel confident we will be able to prepare something unique just for you.","We have very carefully designed, scheduled and crafted this project in such a way as to minimise any potential delays in construction and despatch of finished tables. We are sourcing from local timber suppliers and cabinet makers, of which we have a good working relationship with, for the frames and tops. Freight Australia wide is available with a reputable and reliable courier company ensuring we can supply you with your table whether you're just around the corner, or clear across the country, all at affordable rates.Should we blast past our desired funding goal, and suddenly have a lot more tables to craft than we planned on, then we have the capability to purchase a second machine allowing us to double our table top creation rates."

However, production on the second, The Lancelock, was put on hold because I invested everything I had into the creation, development and manufacture of FlexLock (and FlexSocks.)Meanwhile, Lancelock focus group and testing was beyond expectation, especially with women (the majority of daily cyclists.) So much so, and with theft up 10-30%, again!, I decided I had to get it out there and start saving more bikes and heartache asap, so here I am.As you can see, me and my team of equally thief-hating artisan engineers are already at the final production prototype stage. Handmade in the USA, all Lancelock Titanium Chainmail funding will be used to polish the final products, hire a few more production teammates, pay the patent attorneys (believers haven't been yet,) and ramp up manufacturing and build some inventory to meet anticipated demand.A bike is stolen at least every 3 minutes in the US because our only security choices are the same, cheap foreign-made junk grandpa used - and thieves learned to beat - in the 1970s. It's long past time for a fresh, lightweight, travel-friendly, cut-proof solution that stops 99% of thieves and looks great doing it.The Lancelock (patent pending) is Titanium Chainmail sheathing a proprietary mix of titanium/steel cable and an unpickable, cut-proof patented one-step lock.(Side note: don't throw away those ubars, chains and cables your Lancelock is replacing - I'm putting together a recycle-for-charity system which should be ready later this year.)100% money back if ya don't love it.","As with any revolutionary product that's never existed before, there are always a few hiccups and unexpected surprises.

Research revealed a market glutted with generic, cheaply-made, heavy 50 year old junk, useless cables cops replace for free, and a handful of silly gimmicks. No wonder the FBI reports theft is up 10-30% again and consumers are cynical and resigned!The bike theft epidemic ends now!

The film impacted my friends in a similar way. Not a day goes by when someone doesn't bring Star Wars up. All of us own at least one shirt. And we relish any chance we get to discuss the films and expanded universe we've all grown to love.My name is Max Nieder. The last few years have been all about making my dream of being a filmmaker come true, and I have just completed my first short film, Faces.And my name is Drew Armijo. Recently I've been following my aspirations to become a musician, and an actor as well.When asked about our next project, a passing joke from years ago came to mind. That we should make our own version of Star Wars. And that was our answer: ""A remake of the original Star Wars movies."" It took a while to get off the ground, because the question stopping us was, ""can we really do this?"" And for a bit, it was only a dream. Well, with your help, we can make that dream a reality. We have spent the last months in pre-production. Annotating the original script, beginning work on special effects, and, most rewardingly, casting friends and local actors. They are all ecstatic at the chance to bring new life to their favorite characters. But we need your help to continue. With the money we are asking for, we intend to buy an array of new equipment to make the film look and sound as good as possible. We will also use our budget to create sets and costumes that are as true to the material as possible. Any money left over will be put away for the rest of the Original Trilogy. We want each of the three films budgeted at $10,000. With the other 20 used to cover equipment, crew costs, our transaction fees, and of course making your rewards as rewarding as possible. We intend to begin shooting in Arizona as soon as this campaign is complete. The dialogue and stories will remain the same, but the material will be handled in a more comedic lens. By that we mean we want the audience to be thoroughly entertained by the compelling narrative, but be able to laugh and enjoy along with us. We will be filming it in a more modern world sort of way. For example, we call Han's ship the Millennium Mazda. (And of course, Han will shoot first) As far as rewards go, we will be making posters with ourselves in the classic poses, digital copies to make a fine addition to your collection, T-Shirts, exclusive behind the scenes material including pictures and our annotated scripts, the chance to visit the set (and maybe even be in the movies themselves), the ability to host screenings, and a few surprises. So, this is where the fun begins. Every dollar counts, and each backer means the world to us. We are asking fans of film and Star Wars alike to join us in taking the ultimate fan film trilogy from the deserts of Arizona to a galaxy far, far away.","Often on Kickstarter, a project will warn you of non-completion or failure.  Neither of those are an option for us.  We are dedicated to making our dream a reality, and will spend the money responsibly, and only to better ourselves in making these films.  This is a low-risk contribution, with a fun and rewarding outcome for everyone.Some people have raised concern that we do not own the rights to Star Wars, and this is a viable concern.  However, we are well within our rights to make a fan film and a parody.  Every year thousands of filmmakers young and old submit entries to the official Star Wars Fan Film Contest, and we intend to do the same once we are done.  No challenge is impossible, and no goal of ours will go unreached.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/569893183/the-red-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,569893183/the-red-book,"Reality Bites and It Follows collide in this indie horror film. In Arizona a group of six teenagers, uncertainty looming in their futures after graduation, receive mysterious ancient books, and find themselves being tested and terrorized by a demon. When Iris Miller learns that she alone is destined to survive, she is forced to make the most timeless and defining choice of all: fight or flight?It is easy to be disillusioned with horror today, with many fans of the genre believing that horror is becoming a corporate entity, aiming to attract demographics rather than provide actual thought provoking scares. Of course, once in a while you'll see a diamond in the rough such as 2017's Get Out , the aforementioned It Follows, or the 2018 masterpiece that is Hereditary. But on your average summer weekend, the scares are not to be found at your local cinema. That's what drove us to write a script and envision a film that isn't just truly frightening, but will leave viewers with new things to think about, which is possibly the most important gift film can give us.Last October, writer/director Max Nieder was approached by local actor Jamareon Hayes with an idea about a demon and six high school graduates. Max soon saw the potential of the idea and began adapting the pages of notes Jamareon had into a script. The cast was soon selected, made up of talented local actors, including well known public figures Lovina Hermez, Abdullah Dugalic and Ahmed Dugalic. Many of them already friends with one or the other, giving the group even more of a collaborative feel. The crew was also selected locally, with talented videographers Scott Hall and Johnny Orozco generously offering their cameras and most importantly, their invaluable experience to the film. Over the months, dozens of people became involved in some way or another, and all of them are dedicated, hungry, and ready to make a movie together.So, where will your money go? Towards bringing this vision to life in the desert. Already, we have been blessed with a cast and crew of people, similarly dedicated to bringing this film to life. We just need the strike of lightning here to bring our monster to life.Other independent production companies rate the average cost ""per finished minute"" to be $2,000~$5,000 per minute for Narrative Content. Therefore, the roughly 100 minutes of The Red Book could traditionally cost a minimum of $200,000 to bring to life. We're not asking for that because we already have several things in place.For one, unlike many indie films promoted on Kickstarter, we already have not only our cast and crew, but camera and editing equipment as well. We are asking for money to finish assembling all that we need. This includes money for props, costumes, special effects makeup, and securing the remaining locations. Not to mention, making your rewards as rewarding as possible.Every contribution counts, and means the world to us. We all have a passion here, whether that be filmmaking, storytelling, acting, or something else. Whatever the dream, we're all coming together to make something truly meaningful to us, and we want to share it with all of you.Enjoy this sample of the original soundtrack.","Our biggest risk here is not getting the money to turn our script into a feature film.  Filmmaking is hard.  Every aspect of it is somewhat challenging, but we're not doing this because it's easy, we're doing it because it is our passion.  We're taking on this challenge with a mix of experience, desire, and enthusiasm.  This is our dream, and we're going to do it.  We just need your help."

I could not find any app to manage everything freelance related. I needed a separate app to register my hours for the projects I was doing, a seperate app to generate a CV and so forth.I also had no idea on how many taxes I had to put aside for the income taxes in May. I knew nothing about taxes and I started to research this. I have spent countless hours doing so and even hired a professional to double check everything. I also hired my colleague to finish the design for the website of Notelify. It's just so much to run a company like this, too much to also freelance full-time on the side.Aside that; everything I found in terms of tax rules was in very difficult and confusing long sentences, which I have converted throughout the entire app in easy language for starters like me to understand.If you spend only a little time using the app and putting in your payments you will immediately get real-time advice (changing fields based on input) on how to save the most taxes as a freelancer. There will be generated fields when a payment applies for a certain tax advantage, which most starters don't know about.In the aspect of a Freelance Software Engineer the app already contains everything necessary. Even something that does not exist yet in the market; a real-time indication on the amount of income taxes owed to the government based on the amount of hours worked on projects, invoices and so forth.I have spoken to big IT people, including the Manager Business Market (Manager zakelijke markt) of a Rabobank (one of the Netherlands leading banks) corporation in the Netherlands. I sat through several meetings, in which he would go to his clients and see what the demand was to make my product complete. I have also spoken with Volksbank and even with some CEO's in my network that have gone through the same process as me, building everything from the ground up.Right now, I am at the end of my project and it would be my dream to stop working for others and to make Notelify not only MY future, but the future for freelancers worldwide!Notelify would be possible with your support 🤝I have all the people in my network to make this happen, I have all the IT knowledge necessary for this. I have an intense amount of energy to make this happen as well, as this is my life's work. When I work on this app I am so focussed that it is 8am in the morning before I know it.In 2018 I spent over 1500 hours on this (consulting, programming, thinking, brainstorming) aside my fulltime project, doing very complex work and I managed to release a free beta just last month.This kickstarter campaign would give me the money to live and pay for marketing, design (I got an ex designer from apple in my network), and so forth for a just sufficient time to make this happen. The app is dependant on this campaign to guarantee that it can grow to its full potential.At the end of the day this app is my life story, I am the only board member of the BV company behind it as well and I will make sure that every client will get everything they need in this app as soon as I can implement it!Market research 🧐The younger generation in the Netherlands is different than the generation before them. People are starting at younger and younger ages everyday to startup businesses and become freelancers. There's no denying the statistics that there are a LOT of freelancers out there today, though there's nothing available that combines every aspect of freelancing into one simple administration app. Aside that, there's nothing available on the market that provides you an accurate indication on the amount of income taxes you owe now.Source (in dutch): https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/dossier/dossier-zzp/hoofdcategorieen/is-elders-in-de-eu-het-aandeel-zzp-ers-zo-hoog-als-in-nederland-Follow us🥰Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/notelify/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Notelify-1944976572468370What we will do per amount raised in the campaign💪🏻50.000 euros:100.000 euros:Above:Marketing 🥰We are going to start presenting notelify to freelancers in the Netherlands, starting RIGHT NOW.Next to that we have an audience to pitch the idea for for 100.000 euros, so if this campaign doesn't work out, we will take the network marketing way. In any way, we are putting in all TOP TIER resources to make this app a reality as soon as we can!Final words 🏄‍♂️Have a lovely day and feel free to ask me anything !",The only challenge left for this project is the financial aspect and sales.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stanhurks/pwasite-free-pwa-or-site?ref=discovery_category_newest,stanhurks/pwasite-free-pwa-or-site,"Say what! You read that right, this app will generate apps. It all started from a shed, well not really.Enough about the past, let's think in the present to create the future. I present the app of the future, inspired by the past!It all actually started from my career as a freelancer. To introduce myself, my name is Stan Hurks. I am a 23 year old entrepreneur from the Netherlands. Not many people understand my way of thinking, I grew up right in the middle of the new digital age.Unfortunately I never got the chance to express my true ambitions, so even though I made a lot of money to program for banks and other big corporations, it did not feel right.There were 40 year old managers, who just felt better than me at programming, even though they would never be able to understand someone from Gen-Z, programming since age 9. I am not saying that it's wrong to be 40, it's wrong to claim to be better based on age and/or discrimination. Kids absorb information, Gen-Z just had a heads up in terms of technology. It really is a problem to most developers, they are mostly introverts. Let's stand up for all of them, so they can pursue their own dreams!Yes, this app stands up for talent. It's based on real life events as well, let's talk recruitment!In the IT industry there used to be a branche called recruitment, where sales people would call the big corporations all day to cut them a deal by linking them to a developer. Well, that sounds fair, except it's not.The recruiters sometimes get paid 30 euros for every hour a developer works for them, just by getting a signature of some bank. While not being honest about it either! I worked for a recruitment company in Amsterdam, of which I am not telling the name due to the guidelines of this platform.I don't care if they sue me for this campaign, I am telling you the full truth for the story behind my 'product'. It's my life's work. The recruitment company I worked for had a wheel to spin when someone made a deal, the wheel had prices on it. It was the Wolf of Wallstreet mentality! While the developers were making 3500 euros per month, they got paid the full rate of 70-90 euros per hour.Do you call that a business model? What about a platform that allows collaborating as a team with chat, to allow people to create apps like using a design program without the need for education beforehand. And at a way faster pace, because I am including a solution to all the problems in the field of IT.There will be forums, in which freelancers and project owners can meet, without the need to collaborate with developers, who are mostly introverts. The forums will also be used by the users of the app, to assist each other into learning the field correctly. The app is free, except for commercial goals.Fair game play! No recruitment costs, not even for me. In fact, the only paid feature will be to link the app to a custom domain name. So teenagers can learn the field for free, while sharing their apps together.The app will make the full process so easy, that the time of development decreases to less than 10%.This means that everyone can make 100 euros an hour instead of 70-90 to out-compete the old fashioned big corporations, while the business owners pay LESS for a BETTER result.In other words; teenagers will be legally able to make >250.000 euros per year in class when working full-time as a freelancer on the platform. The only requirement for that is to have a sole proprietorship (chamber of commerce registration).Quality is so much more important than quantity, that by increasing the quality in the field with this app, the quantity increases as well! It will take way less time to finish projects.The most complex things like CSS keyframe animations can now be made with a program that looks like sketch, multi-tasks like blender and creates animations with keyframes easier than Flash could back in the day.All browser-based, it will even work on mobile. The app will be generated to a code base upon file changes to update your FREE [brand name].app.pwa.site sub-domain.When you navigate to the sub-domain of your app, you will be able to add it to your home screen as a (near) native app. Complete with your own splash screen, logo and app title.Everything you could do with frameworks like react, can now also be done by drag and drop. It could be the next step of advancement in the field of technology as soon as the 1st of September this year already.The code base will consist of only the essentials, to bring HTML, (S)CSS and Vanilla Typescript back. Dependencies will become a thing of the past as well, they are bad for performance.You were right, React Live Conference: Due to people using dependencies for everything, they actually forgot how this field worked. It's not funny that developers 'do not know what they are doing'.Today you see courses that charge 8.000 euros to school you into becoming a developer in 14 weeks. They prepare them for the high demand of this market, by rushing it and decreasing the quality in the field.When I started without education, it was a real struggle to get to that position. Let's think of the future, this app will teach teenagers the entire process FOR FREE, by giving them a peek of the generated files of the file they are working on and by using the correct terms of the field for the correct features. Back to basic, no more unnecessary complexity.Anyone willing to learn the field of IT, will subconsciously learn to program and design, while creating their apps by drag and dropping.I am here to prove to the world that it CAN be better, even without money to start with. The big corporations got their priorities wrong in the field, managers are only capable of thinking about money. While talent thinks about the result. It CAN resolve around the result instead of the money!To show you that I am allowing honest competition, I have released every step of my plan to create this app publicly on Facebook first. Nobody knew what was happening, nobody knew that nobody could steal the idea without access to my thoughts! Well, I'm allowing anyone to try it.Every day that I worked on the design, I posted every detail of it. Although, instead of being scared that people would steal my idea, I was gaining an audience of kind people who gave me feedback on the product. To prove my capabilities, as well as to research the target audience and optimize the app for everyone.I started planning this strategy since the 22nd of January this year, when I decided to stop working for the money and bring justice to the field of technology!Beforehand, I developed secret technology without anyone knowing, to generate codebases like I wrote them. I figured a way to create a code standard using solely typescript, which is capable of being generated completely from a UI. It also works way more efficient than the frameworks used in the industry, because I worked without a team.I chose the aurelia framework on purpose, because of its efficiency. Also, because the companies with the big money use the popular frameworks instead. Well, aurelia was made by an ex-angular developer. There must have been a reason right?There is! The framework does not require the usage of a so called 'Virtual DOM', which emulates the entire page AGAIN in memory. Then, there is the advantage of not having to configure any framework related settings like you would need to do in the industry.The list goes on and on, everything has been planned while keeping the dirty game play of big corporations in mind. That's why I did this publicly, because only talent can steal the idea.And they will get an app that makes them literally 10 times the amount they get from their employers, by doing work that's actually appealing to them.The app is where it starts, from here I am planning to do it big! With everyone, no one will give you the entire field without anything in return. That's why I am literally giving a WIN-WIN to everyone except recruiters, while only the corporations pay a fee.So even though it will be free for consumers, it will make both you and me money from the corporations instead of vice versa. I like to work on a partnership basis, advice is just as valuable as money, for example. I dream of a world where we all freelance and where we can have our own companies with 100% of our own shares, instead of dirty deals, while giving a better win than any sales guy could get anyone! Being successful is made impossible by the big corporations, it's time for change!Everything in the world can be automated, although unfortunately it is not allowed by the world play. That changes now, because I am here to show that even making apps can be automated. Just like water fueled vehicles should've been on this planet for about half a century, if only the world was led by talent instead of greediness.It is my aim to stand up for talent, for and with everyone. I will keep it to technology, while also allowing open-source contributors to make money to write extensions in the app. In which they can also learn the process like I can, so they can make their own platform with my platform to reach their dreams, while making more money and fulfillment by learning the essentials simultaneously. School could be fun!Without asking any fee, the profits are for the artist for the full 100%. There will NEVER be ads or sponsored content on the platform. That's a guarantee. No corporation will ever be able to buy my idea for even a trillion USD, because I did this with nothing on purpose.When this goes big, we can change the entire field. Why isn't it possible to render OpenGL in browsers? We CAN make games on mobile with the same graphics, but we are bound to companies who claim patents on ideas. What a wonderful world!The field of app development is what thrives the economy, it has the most demand of any field. By making it easy enough for teenagers, it will decrease the demand and put it to balance, to allow talent to co-exist with us worldwide. This means that existing technology will decrease in value, as the costs of development as well as the quality will bite the dust!After that, it is possible to make programs like Unity browser based as well, to develop and play PS4 alike games on your cellphone. All we need to do is convince the next generation that technology is the only field that can not be automated fully.IT is the field that allows us to automate our entire life. When it is appealing to everyone, the odds of people inventing a solution to automate every field worldwide will increase dramatically, exponentially. This could be the starting point for that, with your support!","Due to the the high demand for the functionality of my product, the main risk and challenge was to get feedback of the target audience while making sure that nobody could steal my idea.I ensured this by creating secret technology, which is capable of generating full codebases from a UI. I managed to create an engine, which allows me to use the Node.JS runtime in the front-end to generate files.Then there was the challenge of setting up a business by myself, because I did not want to share the assets with other business people. Instead, I figured out a way to create a win-win by giving my partners a partner position on the forums. In return for their advice, they can promote their company in the case any business owner on the platform would seek for such expertise in the partners sub-branche of IT.With this strategy at mind, it is my intention to show that you do not always need to pay with cash to help each other!"

It is also known that epigenetic markers are passed on from one generation to the next affecting offsprings with similar symptoms than their parents even though offsprings have not lived in the same circumstances. In the case of African Americans, post-traumatic symptom disorder has been linked to a long history of abuse, but little attention is paid to epigenetics in that context.

Our research aims at opening the discourse on epigenetics in African American history and to incite the implementation of research linking African American specific epigenetics to academic performance. One of the hallmarks of PTSD is the dysregulation of stress response within which secretion of cortisol seems to have a specific profile for African Americans.

Han nästan drunknar i hennes djupa skrattgropar. Det blonda håret är kortklippt och hennes läppar är målade i en svag rosa nyans. De blåa ögonen glittrar av livslust och glädje. På ena kinden sitter ett litet födelsemärke. Hon har en röd kort kjol med en vit djup urringad jumper. Mellan hennes bröst sitter en röd ros, och på hennes ringfinger har hon en stor ring. Den föreställer en orm som slingar sig runt en kniv, och kniven är nästan lika stor fingret. Roger hade träffat henne på Ikea, där han var för att köpa en lampa till sin kolonistuga. Han lade märke till henne  på grund av den kortkorta kjol hon bar. Han rodnar lite för att hans blick söker sig till hennes ben. Han vänder bort blicken och går till avdelningen för lampor i varuhuset. Vad han söker är en golvlampa som skall stå vid läshörnan i stugan. Alla böcker är utlästa, och han har nyss köpt en  bok skriven av Anna Jansson, som heter ”Drömmen förde dig vilse”, med hennes karaktär Maria Wern. Lamporna finns det en del att välja mellan.

Viktor Dalbeck alive who said his job as his best friend and alcohol after his wife has passed away, while he lives with a death wish but still so puts his survival mechanism started in a difficult situation, where he is abducted when he is on a reconnaissance job.This project was started by Andreas Ekelöf having a film his interest and he is 27 years old and his dream is to make his grandfather's story to the movies (3st movies). This crime drama will be with Viktor from child to his retirement.His dream is to start small with in 2017 with the script work. Hope they are many who like my idea and can give small donation.Some text from the story:Dalbeck went out and closed the door behind him. On the gravel path outside the next colony cottage he stopped and will take up his papers on the colonists, given to him by the colony's board of directors. He sighs when he sees how many cabins that must be visited. This would take all day and evening in the claims. He goes through the gate, to the door and tap.Victor is at home in his apartment in the south. He is tired after interviewing all the colonists. According to the clock on the wall, it is already eleven at night. He goes into the bathroom to shower and shave. In the bathroom mirror, he sees a face of the tired man. His face is weathered and cheeks are full with small craters after chickenpox in young age. On the cheeks and nose have superficial blood vessels burst, a sign of long-term and high alcohol intake. The dark hair has splashes of gray, and the nose is a wild adult walrus mustache, which also has some pepper gray. Viktor sighs, undresses and goes into the shower. wonder if Roger Gustavsson know more than he wants to say? Nothing new had arrived at the interrogation of the other colonists. Most had seen Roger with a woman, seen them dance and walk towards the Rogers cabin, but nothing else. No one had seen Maria leave the cottage in the morning. Had she perhaps left Roger at night when he was asleep, and met someone else? After having shaved and dressed himself, he goes into the living room. Viktor takes out a bottle of Chivas Regal 12 years old, beat up a little glass to the brim and sits down in the armchair. He sweeps the whiskey in one move, reaching for the bottle and fill the glass again. A pleasure spreads through the body. His gaze stuck on a photograph that is in the bookcase in front of him. The photo is of his wife for 25 years.","We see no risks associated with the project. If we are to be finicky, perhaps we need to move forward the project, but that the really do not."

While the concept is appealing to a variety of foodie entrepreneurs, the venture is not without its own unique set of challenges. Foodtruckr.com asked food truck owners what they wish they had known before starting their food truck business. Below is a summary of what they said plus a bonus thought.1.  Street Food Red TapeIt seems simple enough. Buy a truck, make good food, park the truck, and sell the food. It’s significantly more complicated than that. For starters, each city, county, and state has its own set of regulations for food trucks. Owners must navigate a series of permits and certifications or be fined. Red tape includes:A seller’s permitHealth department certificationFood safety trainingPermits and licenses for the truck itself (registration, inspection, drivers’ license, etc.)Liability insuranceMobile vending laws2.  Tacos al Pastor y El BañoIn some cities, food trucks are limited by toilet facilities. For example, in LA if a food truck is parked in one location longer than one hour, there must be a bathroom facility within 500 feet. Other cities have similar regulations that become a challenge for food trucks.3.  Parking for Food Truck OwnersYou can’t just park wherever you want. Some food truck parks lease the spots. Others require a percentage of your sales. Often there are waiting lists for parking spots at lunch spots, fairs, farmers’ markets, and other events. It’s more than simply finding an open parking lot and setting up shop, especially if you want a spot in the most highly trafficked areas.4.  A Never-ending Grocery ListFood trucks are built with food preparation in mind, not bulk food storage. As a result, buying in bulk like stand-alone restaurants often do is impractical. Because most food trucks change locations often, ingredient deliveries from vendors are a logistical nightmare. This leaves owners or employees shuttling food from store to truck almost daily. You might argue that it would be more efficient to take the food truck to the supermarket, until you realize that the trucks may only get seven miles per gallon of gas.5.  WeatherYou may have the most efficient system for cooking gourmet food ever known to the food truck industry, but if the weather doesn’t cooperate you won’t sell a thing. Food trucks are at the mercy of weather. Nobody wants to eat a soggy fish taco at a muddy picnic table. Likewise, only a handful of people would trudge through snow and ice to get a slice of pizza they have to eat in freezing temperatures.You can control your food quality and your business plan. You can’t control the weather.6.  Food Truck Owners Must Be Truck DriversIt’s not enough to keep your cooking supplies running properly. You also have to make sure the truck runs reliably enough to get you to scheduled events on time. All trucks require regular maintenance, repairs, gas, and new tires. The more you know about mechanics and automotive repairs, the better off you’ll be.7.  A Bonus Thought: Payment MethodsWhat forms of payment will you accept? Checks are practically obsolete. That leaves cash and credit cards. Some food trucks choose to only accept cash. This may seem to be the simplest solution on the surface, but it leaves the food truck vulnerable in a couple of ways. First of all, when crooks become aware you’re an all cash business you can become a target for robbery. Secondly, you lose any potential customer who doesn’t happen to be carrying cash.So, you need to have a way to accept credit cards or some form of mobile payment. For mobile businesses, a mobile point of sale (mPOS) system makes the most sense. Bindo offers an iPad mPOS that is ideal for food truck owners. With an Internet connection and some minor hardware additions, you’re ready to accept credit cards, debit cards, and Apple Pay.There are enough challenges to the culinary experience of owning a food truck. Don’t let getting paid be one of them."

I’m a web and software developer with a decade of experience. I’ve worked in a variety of environments and companies from Los Angeles to New York City (where I work currently). Brands I’ve worked for include People Magazine, J.Crew, Nestle, and many more. I’m an avid contributor of open-source projects. Although my main focus has resided in producing aesthetic, efficient, and intuitive applications utilizing front end technologies - I enjoy working throughout the stack.Please feel free to checkout my GitHuband LinkedIn.In the continuously evolving landscape of web and software development, Jillion provides an open-source resource management JavaScript framework to embrace the native features of modern browsers, while offering graceful fallbacks for the old. It's an all-in-one solution to emerge from the convoluted space of module loaders, bundlers and other types resource managers.Jillion will be anintuitive, lightweight, easy to use framework, with configuration options. It willprovide the following features with seamless fallbacks:Although various frameworks such as RequireJS, Browserify, and webpack have given our development community something to talk and debate about - we're due for standardization. These frameworks all offer something different, however with the forthcoming adoption of native releases such as ECMAScript 6 and HTTP/2,we are in need of a framework to leverage modern features while gracefully falling back when necessary.HTTP/2This release of HTTP is groundbreaking and the primary inspiration for the development of Jillion. It offers a standardized solution to issues developers face in managing assets among other features. Since support of HTTP/2 is somewhat limited at this time, Jillion will fallback gracefully for older browsers.""HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients."" -HTTP/2 Specification (RFC7540)This project should move fast, but I'm hoping to release the first stable version within 6-12 months.This campaign will jump start this project and help with:","1) Time. Recently, I witnessed a company decide to embark on a project to re-build their mobile website. The project didn't have a distinct leader, and got so out of hand with the number of people and technologies involved that it wasn't completed until 2 years later. In this industry, it's easy to let something like that happen as complexity mounts. I want to steer this project in a way that the goals and milestones are clear, to avoid this scenario.2) Over-architecting. Keeping things simple will be crucial in creating a light-weight product.

Audits run at certain times of the day based on the user's account. Free and premium accounts are available.Features:In March of 2018 Google announced a change in its search engine algorithm to “mobile-first” indexing. Because website performance is an integral piece of mobile friendliness, this put a large amount of revenue in jeopardy for websites that rely on organic searches for business.Foo can be used to monitor website performance to prevent degradation, which could in turn impact revenue for companies relying on organic searches.Foo is a website performance monitoring tool. We would like to expand this functionality to not only monitor performance but also SEO and best practice. Users can get enough out of the free functionality. For that reason, Foo isn't profitable at this time. To expand its functionality we could use funding for engineering and infrastructure additions.Features we want to add with this funding:","The goals and expectations of this campaign have been determined based on familiarity of existing functionality of Foo and what needs to be done to add the new features detailed in the project description. Foo has been stress tested, however with any website there is always a risk of overload. This is true especially when orchestrating a queue of jobs. This risk exists with Foo since it programmatically adds jobs to a queue and executes them via cron. The container servers running these jobs are ephemeral, so spinning up new instances won't be a problem. We could quickly recover and isolate the cause to address."

We will even have polls up on our social media pages for viewers to vote on what big topic we will cover on the fans day show that will happen once a month.",The common risks with any new web based show is one getting it out there. Two getting views and feed back from viewers. Three and the biggest risk of  all is doing what you love and getting it to a point to where it will be loved by the people that watch it. The last risk is that we cant keep the show going cause it doesn't get  monetized and our fans loose out on what we have created for them. The ways that we will over come all of these risks is by creating a show that is different and by keeping the content we share fresh new and mostly live staying true to what NerdWorld is a live show for nerds and non-nerds alike!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nerdworld/nerdworld-a-web-based-live-show-about-nerd-culture?ref=discovery_category_newest,nerdworld/nerdworld-a-web-based-live-show-about-nerd-culture,"NerdWorld is mainly a Live streaming network channel were we talk about all things nerd that will be on social media, YouTube, Twitch and other sites with content that talks about movies, video games. comics, TV Shows, games, anime and nerd culture as a whole with a twist on the views of our cast members from Non-Nerd points of views to hard core gamers, Movies buffs to Mom and kid reviews. We are bringing you a different type of a review show cause we talk about it all from new school to the retro old school. We will have Twitch and Mixer streams to Facebook live content and podcasts. The content that will be made is always different and changing with nerd culture as it changes. Which is why we are here on Kickstarter to get the funding we need for equipment and office space to make better quality content for our epic viewers that tune in to see are views and take on nerd culture and whats happening in it. We are very excited to bring the world of Nerds to a new and hopefully a different prospective from what the world thinks being a nerd is about. We are very passionate about making better content for our viewers in all the ways that we can.","The common risks with any show is getting and keeping viewers, competing in an online market and staying fresh and new with the content. Other risks are keeping the show running smoothly and planning out future events."

I'm a retired electronics engineer who designed the first Wi-Fi cards for both HP/Compaq and Dell some years ago. I even worked in the NXP lab for a short time with Doughty Amplifiers used in cell phone towers.I have written abook ""How to build a high power solid state RF amplifier - An LDMOS Amplifier Handbook""It contains six LDMOS amplifier projectsusing the BLF188XR LDMOS transistor and several support projects that you may need to get your amplifier on the Air. I built the prototypes using simple techniques andthen used Altium designer to model and lay out circuit boards to make it easy for the technically mindedradio amateur to reproduce my results. All the amplifiers are in the same form factor. They are 8x9 inches. They use a 8x9 copper heat spreader which sits atop an 8x9 heat sink with forced air convection cooling. These amplifiers are very stable and the 2.8KW amplifiers of project 4 and 5 will run at the legal limit even in digital and AM modes. I will be marketing kits this fall and now offer PCB's and a few kits as rewards for supporting this project.I designed a support power supply to convert 50 Volts DC to produce 12 volts for the relays and 6 volts for the BIAS current. I reworked a design I did for a commercial customer and increased the current output to 6 Amps (enough to power a QRP rig like an Heath HW-8, Ten-Tec Argonaut or Elecraft transceiver)I have enjoyed building and designing amateur radio gear since I was a teenager and I know other will enjoy building these amplifiers as much as I did. Project     1 is a 160 or 80 meter linear single band amplifier that puts out 1250 watts in Class A/B service. It can be constructed for about $600 and is a great way to improve your country total on the low band on a budgetProject     2 is an amplifiers that produces1250 Watts from 160 to 6 metersProject     3 is a design I first saw in the NXP lab It puts out1400 Watts on the HF bands and was very well designed by NXP.The layout is mine and I have added those features required for amateur operation.Project     4 is aHFlegal limit amplifier - Rated 2.8 KW that is based on a Freescale design. This amplifier loafs along at the full legal limit of 1500 watts. We liquid cooling of the heat sink you can get over 2800 watts out in CW and SSB modes. Project 5 is a 2.8KW amplifier that included 6 meters and is an original design that I now use as my station amplifier. Project6 is a 2.5 KW 160-10m Low Pass Filter Module with relay band switching to use with the above amplifiers.Project7is a small very efficient power supply to supplu 6 volts for Bias and 12 VDC for fans and the relaysI have also included a chapter on front panel enhancements that uses a 2.8"" TFT full color display driven by an Arduino based computer to monitor and control the above amplifiers.  These amplifiers easily fit in a surplus Zero case that I bought in Houston from a surplus dealer. The power supply I used is a surplus HP server power supply (model ESP120) . I have tested all the amplifiers in this book and will be offeringkitssometime next year.I'm using a large heat sink 8x9 inches and matching copper plate 3/8"" thick.iquid cooling or a cold plate is even better. This I leave to you the Amateur radio experimenter.Schematics, Full sized art work and parts lists for all projects are included in this book. This is primarily a book project but as I have made PCB 's for all the above project I am including them as options as reward options.I will also make a few kits and will populate boards for the more expensive rewards. I hope amateurs world wide will enjoy making and using these amplifiers as much as I did. ","I have prototyped and characterized all these designs. The text of the book is compete and all the design work is done.  I used only parts available and in stock they are proven circuits however there is a risk some parts may be out of stock in the future.  I will keep everyone informed that is part of this amplifier build.Operation of this amplifier at the full legal limit of 1500 Watts should be very reliable. I will provide as much assistance as I can to builders. My hope is the book will have all the information necessary to build your own high power amplifier. The selection of case and thermal cooling are up to the builder, These can be challenging to build for the beginner but an experienced kt builder should have no trouble reproducing these amplifiers. The risks are really related to operating and cooling these high power amplifiers. Stay legal (<+1500 watts) and do not scrimp of the heat sink and cooling fans and you should be very satisfied with the performance.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896109729/vmtt-the-virtual-maria-theresa-thaler?ref=discovery_category_newest,896109729/vmtt-the-virtual-maria-theresa-thaler,"VMTT provides a complete and secure solution to the creation of a digital trade coin without the use of Block Chain technologies.Our fractal digital trade coin solution is patent pendingA VMTT is unique and cannot be counterfeited. It can be copied by the owner but such copies can not be spent and are easily detected as counterfeits. Unethical acts will result in loss of privileges to trade.The VMTT is a unique 1 Mega bit fractal Image with a serial number appended to the prefix and a HASH appended to the suffix. The VMTT is backed by Silver exactly as the real Maria Theresa Thaler. When a VMTT is minted, 24.3 grams of silver is deposited in a bank vault. In practice Kilogram bars are purchased and stored in Bank vaults around the world. The amount of silver on deposit is Public knowledge and can be found on our web site with copies of the reciepts. This makes the VMTT stable, one can always cash out in silver or cash by sending us an email. We will send the cash equivalent if this is legal. I anticipate that we will have several locations around the world which will open for this purpose as silver exchanges. Anyone can open a cash exchange and trade VMTT’s for local currency who has client privileges. So how does this system work?A Virtual Thalers is minted at a customer request. They minted on the computer using Fractals and embedded sequences to guard against forgery. Each virtual Thaler bought is then exchanged for silver which is deposited by the mint. A Virtual Thaler has a serial number and time stamp – incremented with each Thaler issued. The thaler has it's 160 bits                Primary Hash appended to the coin- The file as sent also has the owners signature appended and is encrypted with the owners key.This is the bill fold as received from the mint - the payee decrypts the coin and can examine it as any physical coin or bank note.The hash of the sent, encrypted note must match the encrypted coin. the ledger owner must be changed to the payee by the payer as part of the transaction. The appended hash should be extracted and compared to the raw coin as well to see it hasn't been altered. Our transaction software does this automatically.A Coin always has one owner and occupies one ledger line. This prevents coin copying and double spending.Only one ledger operation is permitted - transfer of a coin to another member by changing your ID for the other members. The new owner must update the hash to validate the coin. The hash can be updated only once after the transfer.If one has doubts about a coin, it can be submitted to a vault to be bit checked against the issued notes. This bit check can be run in seconds and is definitive and required for silver redemptions. This is done with a request to a vault and takes a few seconds. As each bill is different and has a limited number of users forgery is not really possible unless one also can manipulate the Vault server.To send a bill or bills takes only the electronic transit time of some milliseconds.The vault servers require a login in and only permit the transfer of your notes and to accept a hash from you for new notes.To send a Bill we use the Diffie Helman key exchange algorithm to derive a common key then the  Payer strips his signature and hash off the BillThe bill is encrypted with the common key and sent to the seller.The seller can examine the bill and if satisfied he appends his signature and derives a new hash. Coins are encrypted with the Twofish algorithm.- The seller sends his hash to Payer again encrypted - or can just change the hash himself after he sees the new owner ID has been postedTo complete the sale the payer must update the ledger with the new hash and the buyer's ID, then the Trade coin is valid again but with a new owner.There are no transaction fees in this protocol.The smallest unit that can be sent is a piece of eight or 1/8 of a VMTT. Trade coin denominations are –100,000 (VMTT) Thalers 10,000 5.000100010025201051 and 1/8 VMTT.. They are minted on demand. A 1% premium to the spot silver price of 24.3 grams of .999 silver is charged. Half of this amount goes to charities, 50% of that to children’s hospitals and women shelters around the world. The other half maintains the vaults and the physical storage of the silver.The security of the bills come from the fact that the hash is known but unlike in Bit chain, the block is not public. A method to reproduce a complex 1 megabyte fractal from a hash that has the proper elements in the right place and is not easily detectable is almost zero but even that will not pass the vault test as in that test the block must match the original bit by bit. As there will be more than one case where the hashes match but not all the bits in order this is bullet proof to a classic mathematical attack.The vault will have provisions to detect attempts to beat the system and we will revoke and cash out folks we believe are bad actors. We also offer bonds which are VMTT's that have not been traded peer to peer but only through a vault , never on-line. These notes are guaranteed without further authentication. All trade with the mint is via one time pad and client software. Ultra secure if your computer is not compromised.The details will be posted to our web site www.HDRadioLabs.com in the next few weeks.""VMTT"" and ""Fractal Dollars"" are c Alexander Kalish      and High Desert radio labs",Writing software to check for security vulnerabilities is the main concern I have. The basic software to build and process VMTT Bills is in house . I will post it on the web site open source. Government actors may attempt to quash the concept as tracking payments and money transfers is very difficult once the coins are in circulation but this is the same as any physical MT Thaler.If this digital coin explodes we could see silver prices spike and a rather rapid increase in the VMTT price. This is not our intention - we hope very stable coins valued by allSchedule - The VMTT Mint and vault websites to be operational March 1st 2018                      All rewards will be shipped by February 21st 2018

If any of my readers have been there, fresh fruit is ridiculously expensive compared to Western Countries. As I am half-Japanese, I understand their culture. Fruits such as cantaloupes, watermelon and blueberries, are viewed as luxurious goods in Japan.

We believe that consumers will buy our product as they want to experience the same taste and quality without paying a large amount of money.As they will be canned goods, exporting and distributing will cost less than fresh goods. They will have the same great quality months ahead. We would not only be exporting to Japan but that is where we believe the market can be penetrated. We would also distribute in Mexico, United States and possibly Australia.We have saved up a large amount of money personally together, to build together with a range of equipment for canning fresh fruit. I have set up as $25000 for our goal but would love to receive as much as we can for other costs such as distribution, marketing, overhead costs. Equipment costs would be for de-sheller, skin peeler, sorting equipment, juicing, canning equipment, cleaner, and more.Please donate for our project, and make our dream come true. We have been working hard to save up as much as we can but we need your help!","By my own research, with questionnaires in Japan, the public would respond positive for this product. Business can use our product for their own purposes (restaurants, catering) which would increase our stock output. Challenges we would face is to pull middle income earners to buy our product. The upper class will still buy the fresh fruits, but lower and middle income earners would tend to buy our canned product."

We lived paying life forward at our own expense. Now we ask others if they could help us continue our quest at discovering and advancing new music.Now that the history of Rock Video TV and it's fund raising efforts had been refreshed for you. Please allow me to go even further and explain our second wave of fund raising efforts. Please help Mike.The following is an autobiographical video montage of Mike's career in broadcasting. The audio used is Mike's original radio broadcasting demo from 1995. It was this single demo that had Mike being hired all over the United States leading his way to his final broadcasting achievement in Las Vegas, NV.(Monkey images are homage to Mike's nieces & nephews.)","Mike is the creator of Rock Video TV. Mike had a decent, short lived career in radio broadcasting. His final broadcasting position was Assistant Promotions Director at KWNR in Las Vegas, NV.Medical & financial hardship within Mike's family caused Mike to give up his career in broadcasting so that he could return home to help his family. Mike had given his life's savings to his family to get them through some extremely difficult times.Upon returning home to his family, Mike attempted to get a radio career in his hometown of Chicago but unfortunately the market was full and there were no opportunities for him.Mike took whatever job he could find. Mike eventually landed a retail job in a field that he is highly knowledgeable, outdoors skills. Mike's greatest hobby was the outdoors. Mike was skilled in camping, hiking, kayaking & fishing. He was excited to find a job at a retailer that focused on his hobby skills set. Mike worked that position for 4 years.Mike's broadcasting communications & sales skills helped Mike excel at his newly found career. Unfortunately that career ended after four years. Mike got injured on the job. Workman's Compensation doctors were in favor of the employer. A case was never able to be made against the employer. The statue of limitations ran out as Mike desperately searched for a lawyer that would take his case.Now Mike's primary Care Physician as well as several specialists have been able to determine Mike's condition and that Mike's physical disability can be dated back to when he was working at the outdoors retailer. Mike is currently undergoing investigation as to whether or not he is eligible to receive Disability Benefits for the damage that was caused to him.During the last year, Mike had lost his home recording studio to a flood. His workstation desk and walls were all destroyed with water damage. He was able to rescue & salvage some of the electronics. Mike is looking for help in rebuilding his home studio as well. This would allow him to be able to podcast from his home, allowing him to try to make a living through podcasting.Mike needs financial help with the costs of removing the current drywall, removing black mold, purchasing new building materials such as lumber, drywall, conduit and accessories. Mike also would like help getting a new Omnirax workstation, a new Behringer mixing board and one year's worth of Premium air time on BlogTalkRadio website.The combined total of both fund raising efforts for producing Rock Video TV as well as repairing Mike's basement & studio would be in excess of $150,000 to $200,000 or more.MIKE IS ONLY ASKING FOR $25,000If a million people saw this fund raiser and each donated a nickel, Mike would have doubled his goal!! Now, imagine the dreams you could create if a million people each donated one dollar.Hopefully the general public that comes across this will understand that this is a good man, a hard working man who never asked for anything in his life but instead always gave of himself to others. Now in his darkest days, the least that can be done is finally give back to a man who had pretty much lost almost everything. His career, his family, his health.Please help a good man try to make a living for himself.Please.Kickstarter doesn't allow for any images or videos to be posted in the Risk & Challenges category so if you would like to see images of Mike, the damage done to the basement or see any additional videos of Mike or Rock Video TV then feel free to email us for the information.(This fundraiser had originally been created by Mike then edited by his family & friends.)"

Wieso solltest Du dich mit itsmee. befassen?Unser Leitspruch “Von Studenten für Studenten” versuchen wir in unser Konzept und unsere Ziele einfliessen zu lassen und möchten dem User das Gefühl von Zusammenhalt, Einheit und Freude vermitteln. Das Ziel von itsmee.  ist es, ein Netzwerk zur Verfügung zu stellen, welches dem Studenten die Möglichkeit bietet, mit seinen Kommilitonen, bei itsmee. als Connections bezeichnet, in Verbindung zu stehen und auch nach der gemeinsamen Studienzeit mit seinen Studentenbuddys in Verbindung zu bleiben. Im Gegensatz zu bestehenden sozialen Netzwerken, gibt es bei itsmee. weder die Kommentarfunktion noch die lästige Pinnwand-Funktion, die einen Überfluss an Werbung und Informationen zulässt. Aber ohne Pinnwand kann es doch keinen Informationsaustausch geben? Fragst Du dich sicher. Natürlich gibt es bei itsmee. sog. Blackboards, auf denen man Bilder, Videos und Blogs hinzufügen kann. Nur ist es bei itsmee. so, dass dies auf drei unterschiedlichen Blackboards geschieht. Picmee. Steht für Bilder und deren Glanz. Blogmee. für interessante Texte und die Gefühle die sie auslösen. Zu guter Letzt Entertainmee. für die Unterhaltung in Form von Videos. Deine Einträge ""Posts"" werden auf diesen drei Blackboards angezeigt, was den Überblick über die Einträge massiv erleichtert. Das Ganze wirkt aufgeräumt und Du kannst selbst entscheiden welche Inhalte, seien es Bilder, Texte oder Videos, Du zur gegebenen Zeit sehen möchtest.Ganz nach dem Motto “Back to the Roots” möchten wir ein Soziales Netzwerk aufbauen, welches sich um den Menschen und seine Interessen dreht und nicht nur eine Werbeplattform darstellt. Wie bewerte ich einen Eintrag, wenn es keine Kommentar-Funktion gibt? Teile deinen Freunden mit, wie Du zu ihren Einträgen stehst, indem Du unser Bewertungssystem nutzt. Positive und negative Einstellungen gegenüber einem Eintrag kannst Du direkt über den Like/Dislike Button abgeben. Jap, du hast richtig gelesen “Dislike-Button” juhuuu, endlich!! ^^Wie kann ich sonst noch mit meinen Connections kommunizieren?Um mit Deinen Connections schnell, unkompliziert und persönlich kommunizieren zu können, stellen wir Dir zudem noch ein Nachrichtentool zur Verfügung. Wer steckt hinter itsmee.?Zwei junge, dynamische und motivierte Studenten (beide 22 Jahre alt) hatten vor einiger Zeit die Idee, die Dinge, welche andere soziale Netzwerke gut gemacht haben, zu nehmen und daraus etwas gänzlich neues zu erschaffen. Wie bereits beschrieben, sind wir jung, dynamisch, motiviert und kommen von der HSG bzw. der HSR. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What is itsmee. and what are our Benefits? What distinguishes us? Why you should deal with itsmee. ?Our motto “from students for students” are we trying to let flow in onto our draught and our aims and we would like to provide the feeling of cohesion, unity and joy for all our users. The aim of itsmee. is to make a network available for Students which offers the possibility to stay in contact with all their student colleagues not just during their University time but also after their common study time. In contrast to existing social networks, there is neither the comment function nor the tiresome story board function which admits an abundance in advertisement and information. But, nevertheless, without story boards there can be no exchange of information? Are you asking yourself. Of course there is something like a story board but we call it ""Blackboards"", on which one can add pictures, videos and Blogs. It is only with itsmee. that this happens on three different Blackboards. Picmee. Stands for pictures and their shine. Blogmee. for interesting texts and the feelings, they release. Finally, Entertainmee. for the entertainment in form of videos. Your entries ""Posts"" are displayed on these three Blackboards what makes it easier to overview the ""Posts"" massively. The whole look is tidy and you can decide by yourself which contents, are these pictures, texts or videos, you would like to see at the given time. Completely after the motto ""Back to the Roots"" are we interested in building up a social network which is directed to the person and his interests and is not only an advertising platform.How do I value a Post if there is no comment function?Inform your friends how you stand to their Posts, while you use our Rating system. You can give both positive and negative ratings with our Like/Dislike Buttons. Jap, you have read properly ""Dislike Buttons"" juhuuu, finally!! ^^How can I else communicate with my Connections?To be able to communicate with your Connections fast, uncomplicated and personally we have developed a messenger service where you can write messages to your connections. Who is behind itsmee.?Some time ago two young, dynamic and motivated students (both 22 years old) had the idea to take the things which other social networks have made good and to create something totally new with it. As already described, we are young, motivates and come from the University of St. Gallen (HSG) and the Univerity of Technologies (HSR).",I am a BWL Student and have some knowledge about leading and how to go through bad times.

Möchtet ihr eine ""sichere"" & ""privatsphärebeachtende"" Alternative zu Facebook und co.?Dann ist itsmee. genau das Richtige!!itsmee. soll ein soziales Netzwerk darstellen, welches sich von selbst auflöst. Jeder Post - sei es ein Bild oder ein Text - ist für 24h sichtbar und Du kannst selbst bestimmen, welche Einträge Dir gefallen oder eben nicht. Durch die Verwendung des like/dislike Button kannst Du dem jeweiligen Post 15 Minuten an Zeit schenken oder nehmen. Nach Ablauf der Zeit löscht sich der Eintrag von alleine und itsmee. speichert nichts!!Es besteht lediglich ein Bewertungssystem mit like/dislike Button und ohne Kommentarfunktion. Dies soll die Verbreitung von Mobbing eindämmen und Dir einen zusätzlichen Schutz bieten.Bilder und Texte sind auf zwei verschiedenen sog. ""Blackboards"" untergebracht. Dies haben wir so entschieden, um die Übersichtlichkeit zu gewährleisten und uns von all den Anderen Netzwerken zu differenzieren.Wichtig: Alle Daten werden auf einem Schweizer Server vorübergehend nur solange gespeichert, bis der Timer des Eintrags abgelaufen ist. Nach dieser Zeit sind alle Daten gelöscht!Weil auch nur ein Minimum an persönlichen Informationen im Profil angegeben werden müssen, wird auch hier nichts Persönliches gespeichert.Der Name kann auch ein erfundener Name sein und muss nicht dem echten entsprechen.-----------------------Are you tired of social networks constantly collecting and sharing your data?

Every post - be it a picture or a text - is visible for 24h and you can decide for yourself which entries you like or don't like. By using the like/dislike button you can give or take 15 minutes of time to each post. After the time expires the entry deletes itself and itsmee. stores nothing!There is only an evaluation system with like/dislike button and without comment function. This is intended to curb the spread of bullying and provide you with additional protection.Pictures and texts are stored on two different ""blackboards"". We decided to do this in order to ensure clarity and to differentiate ourselves from all the other networks.Important: All datas are temporarily stored on a Swiss server until timer of a post has expired. After this time all data will be deleted!Because only a minimum of personal information has to be entered in the profile, nothing personal is stored on itsmee. either.The name can also be an invented name and does not have to correspond to the real name.",Because we have such a big competition on the market it could be difficult to earn economy of scale. For this reason we have to focus on marketing and a good front-end of our App. Right now lot of social media companies are in bad light because of data scandals. That's why it's time for change and a social network to keep that in mind.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wristruments/shoe-straps?ref=discovery_category_newest,wristruments/shoe-straps,"About a year ago, I had an idea for a new product. ShoeStraps are a footwear accessory that conceal your tied shoelaces, and allow you to add a little personality and flare to your sneakers. They are attached directly to your shoelaces, and are secured to your shoes through the tying of a knot. I've created two different styles of ShoeStraps: Athletic and Casual.               How the Athletic ShoeStrap Works:1. Insert the ends of your untied laces through the backside of your ShoeStrap.2. Pull your laces through the lace containing pocket.3. Tie your initial basic knot, then pull upwards, removing any slack in your laces.4. Pull the ends of your laces away from your shoe, fastening your ShoeStrap to the tongue of your shoe.5. Continue tying your knot as you normally would.6. Insert your completed knot into the pocket of your ShoeStrap.         How the Casual ShoeStrap Works:1. Insert the ends of your untied laces through the sides of your ShoeStrap.2. Tie your initial basic knot.3. Pull your the ends of your laces away from your shoe, fastening the base of your ShoeStrap to the tongue of your shoe.4. Continue tying knot as you normally would.5. Insert tied knot through the middle aperture, and fold the top half of yourShoeStrap over your knot, securing it to the tongue of your shoe.As a college student with little experience, and no money, I did what any striving entrepreneur would do. I called my girlfriend to borrow her mom's sewing machine, grabbed a pair of scissors, and started collecting materials that looked promising. Old backpacks, articles of clothing, shower bags, even a few folding chairs. If I got my hands on it, there was a good chance it was going to get cut up and turned into a ShoeStrap.It didn't take me long to realize I had no clue what I was doing, but I kept at it, and eventually started to see my work improving. Now, 80 ShoeStraps later, my hands are basically turning into large calluses, and I think my friends are getting a little annoyed finding large squares missing from their bags and clothes. So, I've decided to put the scissors aside and takeShoeStraps from anidea to a business. This is where you come in. As hard as they are to part with,I am offering up my babies. By supporting ShoeStraps,you will receive one of the first 80 ShoeStraps ever made(including certificate of authenticity); designed, cut, and sewn by yours truly. You will also receive a credit for one pair of professionally made ShoeStraps, redeemable as soon as the website is up. Below are pictures of the different ShoeStrap prototypes I'm offering.Well, thanks for reading. Hope you all enjoyed my story and product.                Most importantly, Stay Strapped!","One major challenge I've been dealing with is the protection of my product.  I was anxious to share ShoeStraps with the world, but didn't have $6000 to hire an attorney and file a patent.  I knew it was essential to have some kind of protection before introducing my product, so I started doing research of my own.  Recently before starting this Kickstarter project, I wrote and submitted a utility patent by myself.  Other problems that may arise in the future include manufacturing and license hindrances, but just like the story I just told, my drive to make this happen is unmatched.  By funding ShoeStraps you are also putting your faith in me.  When a problem arises, I overcome it.  I don't quit.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wristruments/wristruments-learn-to-play-the-guitar-from-your-sm?ref=discovery_category_newest,wristruments/wristruments-learn-to-play-the-guitar-from-your-sm,"""The Wristrument smart watch is perfect for the aspiring musician in your life!

What if you every time you picked up an instrument, you had an entire library of lessons, and songs at your fingertips? Wristruments uses smartwatches in a never before seen way to teach you the guitar while you play, without ever taking your eyes off the instrument.Our patent pending technology aligns instructional content with your natural line of vision while you learn. Instead of frustratingly switching your focus back and forth between reading instruction and applying it to what you're playing, Wristruments puts the info right where you need it.We have filed the following provisional utility patents:1.

""A Method for Displaying Instructional Information on a smart watch device that positions and aligns the display in the same visual field as the activity being performed""","The biggest risks associated with our project will be integrating Wristruments in the most effective way with current learning methods.

Unlike a thick corn dog breading, cattails come out light and crispy, golden brown and always complementary to the type of bratwurst that you choose!The menu will also be anchored by grilled big burgers with the option of cheeses and veggies. Snacks, a few delicious sides and of course a Bring Your Own Fish Special where we will fry your catch for you in our secret batter!Our main location will be Cabin O' Pines Resort with the possibility of other locations around the lake and in the area when demand needs to be supplied. We have a plan for the size and camper setup, a builder ready to construct the camper, a great local food supplier and staffing plan for the whole summer season. Our hope is to be open and available as much as possible, but not to interfere with the quiet calm and secluded nature of Pelican Lake and Orr, Minnesota.","Our biggest challenge will be staffing. However, we have discovered a community of workers who travel the country with their trailers and motor homes working in exchange for a beautiful place to camp for the season. We are hopeful to find a work camping couple to run the food truck during the summer. There are other challenges as well. We do not have the camper yet, but are looking forward to finding one that is unique, compact and fun to manage. We will need commercial equipment, full hookups, health department inspections, signage, training, licenses etc.The challenges are plentiful, but with enough support and funding, there is no reason this business cannot be a reality by next summer!Help us make something delicious!"

Copies of the Bible were collected and burned. Thousands were massacred. Finally, in their hour of need a hero arose. This defender of the people was called Judah the Maccabee. (Maccabee is from the Aramaic word for hammer-due to the way he hammered back the Greeks.) Every year the Jewish people celebrate the exploits of Judas Maccabee during the Festival of Hanukkah. This film will be based on the graphic novel that I wrote and illustrated on the Hanukkah story that is entitled ""THE HAMMER OF GOD."" This movie will tell the story of Hanukkah in a historically accurate manner.I have acquired costumes and armor. I will be teaming up with ""WalkerCable Productions of Conroe, Texas and we anticipate that we will be filming at Alamo Village at Brackettville, Texas.This story is based on the First and Second Books of Maccabees in the Bible, the writings of the historian Josephus-and my comic book adaptation of the Hanukkah story that I had entitled ""The Hammer of God.""New Movie to tell the story of the first Hanukkah:Many people associate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah with the holiday season, but few people know of the popular festival’s historical basis. Now, the exciting story of the first Hanukkah will be told in an upcoming movie, based on a script written by Stephen Missick. “167 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, the Syrian Greek tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes tried to exterminate the Jewish faith. Thousands of people were put to death because of their belief in the Holy Bible,” Missick said, “When all seemed lost suddenly a hero appeared who rescued the Jewish people from destruction. This hero’s name was Judah Maccabee. “Maccabee” means “Hammerer” in Aramaic. He was probably called this because of the way he hammered back the Greeks in order to bring deliverance to the Jewish people. Therefore I named the comic book adaptation that I wrote and illustrated “The Hammer of God.”Stephen Missick is adapting his graphic novel “The Hammer of God” into a film entitled “Hanukkah: The Story of the Maccabees.” “Hanukkah is an incredible story. It is you have a group of Jews with no weapons or military training who were able to defeat one of the strongest military forces of the time. I also think that it is a very relevant story with the threats to religious freedom around the world, even in the United States, and also the rise of anti-Semitism that we see,” Missick said.Rev. Missick is partnering with WalkerCable Productions of Conroe, Texas to produce the movie. It is anticipated that the filming will be at Alamo Village at Brackettville, Texas. “There are several great sets in Brackettville that we can use for this movie and WalkerCable Productions have filmed there several times before. I have also acquired a wardrobe consisting of several screen used costumes that have been used in various “swords and sandals” movies.Stephen Missick’s “Hanukkah: Comic and Coloring Book” and “Judas Maccabeus: The Hammer of God” are available from Amazon and other booksellers. Sample of the Comic Book:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4999XxQn-M&list=UUUYbyISn2CGmNvKCcfb4ZgwOur Production Team:",The main risk and challenge on this project is getting a battle elephant for  a scene in the later part of the movie! There may also be challenges at our location and choreographing battle scenes.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/360405228/apostle-thaddeus?ref=discovery_category_newest,360405228/apostle-thaddeus,"The story of Thaddeus: the Apostle of Christ, to be producedby Houston area pastor.(Cleveland, Texas) LorenzoLamas, 1980s heartthrob and star of the hit series “The Renegade,” is set toportray the Apostle Thaddeus in an upcoming biblical epic. The movie will be produced by Walker CableProductions, and filmed near San  Antonio, Texas. The working title of the film is “The Acts of the Apostle Thaddeus.”Lamas said, “Ihave worked with Walker Cable Productions in several films on the course of thelast several years and it is my understanding that they will be producing afilm on the Apostle Thaddeus in the near future. Based on my former associationwith this company and the integrity of Sam Cable and Chuck Walker as friendsand film makers, I have a strong interest in being involved in this project asan actor in the title role of Thaddeus. I find the script interesting andcaptivating and look forward to making this project a bigsuccess. I am thrilled to be working onThaddeus, the new WalkerCable production. These are terrific guys and awonderful production company that I have had the pleasure of working with many,many times in the past. So, if you have the opportunity to invest in aWalkerCable production don’t hesitate. You will not regret it. So, I am excitedabout being a part of this Christian movie. I think it is an important time forour society to embrace the Christian faith. I am looking forward to it.”“The Acts of the ApostleThaddeus” tells the story of the Apostle Thaddeus evangelizing Mesopotamia andfounding the Assyrian Church of the East. The story is based on the writings ofthe early church fathers and traditions of Assyrian Christians, who are theindigenous people of Mesopotamia. The screenplay is based upon the Biblicalaccount as well as other ancient sources, such as the Ecclesiastical History ofEusebius, written circa 325 A.D., the writings of Armenian HistorianMovses Khorenatsi (circa 410-490 A.D.), and ancient Syriac books such as “TheDoctrine of Addai” and “The Acts of the Apostle Mari.”Along with Lorenzo Lamas and Walker Cable Productions,it is hoped that the production crew and cast will include some AssyrianAmericans. This will enable these Assyrian Americans to learn about the art offilm-making and perhaps launch their careers in either film production oracting. Being people who’s heritage thefilm is depicting, they bring with them an additional layer of accuracy andauthenticity. The movie will depict theorigins of the Assyrian Church. Iraqi Christians are currently facing terriblechallenges and persecution.They facethe threat of genocide in their ancestral homeland by Islamic militants groups,perhaps the most recognizable being ISIS.These terrorist groups are actively trying todestroy the ancient Christian community founded by Thaddeus and Thomas. In theearly 20th Century, the Turkish government carried out a massivegenocidal campaign against Armenians in which about one million ArmenianChristians were killed along with thousands of Assyrian and Greek OrthodoxChristians.Stephen Missick, an ordainedminister and military chaplain, is writing and producing the biblical moviethat will dramatize the story of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. The script is derived from the Bible andother ancient sources, such as the writings of the Early Church Fathers. The film is anticipated to be produced byWalkerCable, Productions of Conroe, Texas. WalkerCable plans to begin filmingin early 2015. Existing movie sets at the AlamoVillage in Brackettville,Texas, as well as other areas around San Antonio, will serve asBiblical Lands. “From the very beginning ofthe film industry, movies dramatizing stories from the Bible have beenmade. Many of these films are classics,such as Cecil B. DeMille’s “The TenCommandments” and Charlton Heston’s “Ben-Hur.” However, I want to do somethingtotally different. I want to do something that audiences have never seen before”Missick said. In this movie, Pastor Missickwill be telling the story of the Apostle Thaddeus. According to early ChurchHistorians, Thaddeus evangelized and established Churches in what are today Iraq, Iranand southern Turkey.The movie “The Acts of the ApostleThaddeus” is about the Apostle Thaddeus, known among Aramaic speaking Christiansas Mar Addai, and the founding of the churches of the east. The movie will bebased on ancient Syriac Christian literature, namely “The Doctrine of Addai”and “The Acts of the Apostle Mari.” It is also based on other ancient sources,such as the writings of the early church historian Eusebius. According to Pastor Missick,“The Acts of Thaddeus” tells the story of the origin of the Assyrian Church ofthe East. Pastor Missick describes thestory of Thaddeus as a very fascinating one: “According to Church historians,Thaddeus was the groom at the marriage of Cana in Galilee, where Jesus turnedthe water into wine.”Recent cinematic history hasseen the resurgence of the Biblical Epic. “The Bible: TV Miniseries,” “The Sonof God, “as well as “Noah,” have been very successful.In addition, faith-based films such as “God’sNot Dead” and “Heaven is for Real” have proven there is large an underservedmarket for films in the Biblical genre.Soon, Biblical epics such as “Exodus: God’s and Kings” and “A.D.: Afterthe Bible” will arrive on both the big and small screens to serve thesemarkets.This project is unique in thatthe story of Thaddeus and the founding of the Assyrian Churchhas never before been told in film.The story of Thaddeus contains the story of the mysterious ""Image of Edessa"" -which many people believe to be the same as The Shroud of Turin.",We will be filming outside of San Antonio in Texas. It will probably be very hot on the set. Our team has a great deal of experience filming on tight budgets and harsh conditions so everything should work out fine!

During Loi Krathong, rafts are individually decorated using many objects, including banana leaves and flowers.In the year 1364, one of King Phra Ruang’s servants, Nang Noppamart, had the desire to create a unique decoration for her raft. Nang carved a flower from a vegetable using a real flower as a pattern. She carved a bird as well and set it beside the flower. Using these carvings, she created a raft that stood out above the rest. King Phra Ruang was impressed by the grace and beauty of the carving and decreed that every woman should learn this new art.As the centuries passed, enthusiasm for this art waxed and waned. In 1808, King Rama II loved vegetable carving so much so that he wrote poetry about it. However, during the 1932 revolution in Thailand, appreciation for vegetable carving died down.We would liketo resurrect the art of food carving, by creating an online store for carving art delivery and oncall food carving specialist in NYC area.These carvings can be a great decoration for any event, any guest will be impressed with these:","Our great risks are not getting enough funds, there may be lots of expenses, especially to meet all legal requirementsWe may meet such challenges like being invisible on the market.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/749625589/draft-beer-store?ref=discovery_category_newest,749625589/draft-beer-store,"It makes a significant difference of buying a bottled or canned beer vs draft!

More particularly, this invention relates to an online virtual operating system. BACKGROUND[0002]	As computer technology improves, the data processing speeds and data storage capacities of computer systems are constantly increasing. Software developers are constantly providing upgraded software to take full advantage of the hardware improvements. Thus, hardware improvements push software improvements and visa-versa. [0003]	As a result of the continuous improvements in computer technology, the computer user must periodically made expensive upgrades of computer hardware to keep up. Without such hardware upgrades, the user’s computer becomes outdated and unable to run the latest software. Upgrades of data storage hardware generally require transferring user data from the old storage device to the new storage device. Such transfers can be troublesome and time consuming, especially for inexperienced computer users.[0004]	What is needed, therefore, is a virtual computer system that is always maintained with up-to-date hardware and software, which is accessible via the Internet using a computer that need not have the most up-to-date hardware and software.SUMMARY[0005]	The above and other needs are met by an online virtual operating system that provides a browser-accessible virtual computer via the Internet. The virtual computer appears to the user to have a hard drive with selected capacity, a selected type of processor, RAM of selected size, and a selected operating system. In a preferred embodiment, the virtual hardware and software specifications are selected by the user during a setup procedure. Because the virtual machine is always up-to-date with the latest hardware and software, the system relieves the user from concern about computer components becoming obsolete. Thus, the user does not have to worry about upgrading to a new computer and moving the user’s data over to a new computer.[0006]	In a preferred embodiment, the user sets up the virtual computer’s specifications by selecting the desired type of operating system and the amount of storage needed for saving files, such as pictures, music files, games, game saves, and computer programs. The user can also select the amount of RAM and the type of processor for their virtual computer. [0007]	During the set up procedure, the user selects whether the virtual computer is to be accessible on any network connection or only through the IP address for the user’s home network. If the user selects the user’s network IP address, the virtual computer will only allow connection from that Internet connection. If the user selects to connect from anywhere, the user can connect to the virtual computer from anywhere they wish. The user can also set the virtual computer to only accept connections from certain “white listed” locations, such as a friend’s house. If a company has more than one location, they can allow connection from all locations, while preventing connections from outside the company’s network. This makes hacking more difficult, as no connection to the virtual computer will be allowed from any network IP address that is not on the white list.[0008]	After the user has selected the desired computer specifications, the system provides a: -	Public DNS (IPV4) Address, which looks like a web URL address (i.e., Server1143.US1.Domain.com). This is the public hostname of an instance, which resolves to the public IP address or elastic IP address. -	IPV4 Public Address, which is an IP Address (i.e., 173.149.63.2) that allows the user to connect to the virtual computer via a browser, a desktop program, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or other ways as long as the user has an Internet connection. -	Computer Log Number (Instance ID), which is a unique ID given to the virtual computer. If there are problems with the connection to the virtual computer, or if there is a need for troubleshooting, the technical support person can more easily identify the virtual computer. -	Private DNS, which indicates the location of the virtual hard drive on which all of the user data (pictures, documents, files and other important data) are stored. This is the private, internal hostname that resolves to the instance’s private IP address. (i.e., (Private IP) - us1.domain.com) -	Private IP, which is an IP address linked to a physical hard drive or other physical storage device associated with the physical machine from which the virtual computer is being accessed. Using this address, the user’s online virtual hard drive can be linked to the storage device of the physical computer as a network drive, so that files can be uploaded and downloaded to and from the online virtual hard drive. -	Connect Code, which is a code used when logging in for the first time from a new device or new network location.[0009]	Once the user has set up the specifications of the virtual computer and received the above described information, the user can connect to the virtual computer. The connection can be made using any one of several ways, although only one connection to the virtual computer is allowed at a time. If a second login is made from a second device or location, the first connection will be terminated and a message window will appear at the terminated device indicating that the disconnection was due to a second login from another location or device. [0010]	The ways by which a user can connect to the virtual computer include: -	Browser. The user enters the web address assigned to the virtual machine in a browser, along with the user’s Public IP or Connect Code. When the Public IP or Connect Code is confirmed, the user enters their User Name and Password. Upon validation, the user has access to their online virtual computer. -	Desktop Program. Using a program that has been downloaded to a physical computer (not an online virtual computer), the user enters the user’s Public IP or Connect Code. When the Public IP or Connect Code is confirmed, the user enters a User Name and Password. Upon validation, the user has access to the virtual computer. -	Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). As the virtual computer is running from a server, the user can connect to it using RDP. Through RDP, the user enters the Public IP to gain access to the virtual computer, which will prompt the user for a User Name And Password. -	Boot File. The user has an option to download an ISO or USB boot file to a USB drive or compact disc (CD). Using the USB drive or CD, the user can boot directly to the virtual computer without having to enter login credentials, so as long as there is a Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection. Virtual computers having different specifications can be set up to boot from different USB drives or CDs. In some embodiments, the boot file may be an Xbox 360 executable (XEX) boot file.[0012]	Other embodiments of the invention will become apparent by reference to the detailed description in conjunction with the figures, wherein elements are not to scale so as to more clearly show the details, wherein like reference numbers indicate like elements throughout the several views, and wherein:[0013]	. DETAILED DESCRIPTION[0014]	As shown in FIG. 1 a preferred embodiment of an online virtual operating system includes a server computer connected to the Internet through an encrypted connection. The system includes a user computer that is also connected to the Internet. In general, the user computer may be a basic device that includes a fairly low-speed processor (such as … (2.50GHZ) minimum specs for processor …), a minimal amount of RAM (such as … (0.5 GIG) minimum specs for RAM …), a network interface device (i.e., Ethernet or Wi-Fi), a user interface device (i.e., keyboard, mouse, touchpad), and display device. Generally, an Internet connection speed of at least about 3 MB/sec should be available to the user computer. In some embodiments, the user computer includes a CD/DVD drive or USB port for loading a boot file. [0015]	The server computer includes a Structured Query Language (SQL) data storage location , an SQL database, and an SQL user data storage location. The SQL storage location contains files and programs saved by the user, such as image files, video files, audio files, game settings files, and document files. The SQL database contains the virtual operating system. The SQL user data storage location contains user data, such as the user’s login credentials. [0016]	An encrypted connection is provided between the server and the Internet … Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with encryption keys this employs a strong multi-factor encryption. The server encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. The server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt the user’s data.…[0017]	A preferred embodiment of the system provides four options through which the user computer may access the server to run the virtual computer operating system. In a first option, the virtual computer is accessed via an HTML5 host and browser program . Because the HTML5 Client is a Web Application, usage of the computer is not tied any one device or location. As long as you have access to a web browser, you have access to the online virtual computer… In a second option, the virtual computer is accessed via a desktop program that is running on the user computer . … ( The desktop program is programed to connect directly to the Desktop SQL database to allow connection easier) … In a third option, the virtual computer is accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). … The RDP the user will enter the Domain or ip of the server where there computer is located and will enter the user name and password all three must be entered … In a fourth option, the virtual computer is accessed via a boot program stored on a storage device , such as a CD/DVD disk or USB flash drive . … The user might be able to download the boot file from the website ( unknown at the moment) …[0018]	A preferred embodiment of a process for implementing the online virtual operating system is depicted in FIG. 2. A connection is established between the server and the user computer such as through the Internet using a connection protocol The connection may be established via the browser, such as using HTML(5) RDP via the desktop program via RDP 28 or via the boot program[0019]	If connecting using the browser, desktop program, or RDP, the user is prompted for user credentials and/or a domain/IP address The SQL user data storage locationis accessed to verify the validity of the user credentials . If the credentials are valid the user computer is provided access to the virtual computer At this point, the operating system windows displayed on the user computer are generated by the virtual computer, and it appears to the user that the user computer is the virtual computer. [0020]	If connecting using the boot program, the user computer 36 is booted from the boot program on the storage device. In this case, as long as the boot file is valid and there is no existing connection from another user computer, there is no need to enter user credentials to complete the login procedure . If the boot is valid , the user’s data is accessed from the SQL data storage location and the user computer is provided access to the virtual computer . If the boot is not valid , the user enters the login credentials . If the login credentials are valid the user’s data is accessed from the SQL data storage location and the user computer is provided access to the virtual computer. If the login credentials are not valid the user may reenter corrected credentials [0021]	… Step 1 : User will Create an account which includes Email And password Step 2: User will set up billing information ( will not be charged to an online virtual computer set up is complete and confirmed) Step 3: User will begin setting up there first computer Step 4: User will select Operating System Step 5: User will select instance type (these are preconfigured to help the user such as 1 vCPUs, 2.5 GHz, Intel Xeon Family, 1 GiB memory) Step 6: user will select the amount of storage the wish default is set at 30GB Step 7: The user will select how many instances (Virtual computer) they want to set up with the same specs Step 8: the user can set up a Tag ( Set their own Virtual Computer Password ( less Secure) Step 9: the user will select the security group ( this is where the user will choose if the computer will connect outside of their home network and if so they will enter the selected information) Step 10: the user will review the information they selected for their online virtual computer and confirm for payment Step 11: After confirming the system will set up the Generate IP, username and password ( if not chosen Virtual computer take about 10 mins Step 12 user can now connect. …My Website ishttp://potterservice.com/Pricing Has not yet been determined yet but Here is what im thankingOffering a free program which is capped at the min specs that are available for people with low income.There will be a monthly price and a yearly price.The standard system includes at the moment 1.5GZ processor 30GB hard drive and Min internet speed of 15MBPS and Boost speed to 80MBPS for downloads and VideosFor each additional 10GB of storage is $1/Month and $10/YearFor each additional 100GB of storage is $5/Month and $50/YearVirtual Computer Internet speeds:Speeds up to 20-MBPS and Boost Speed of 80-MBPS are included at no charge with setup of Online ComputerSpeeds up to 100-MBPS and Boost Speed of 300_MBPS are $3/Month and $33/YearSpeeds up to 500-MBPS and Boost Speed of 1000-MBPS are $10/Month and $100/YearI do not have any ideal pricing information for processors as i do not have very much information about how much they will cost meIF have any question please fell free to message me",Risks: Not Being Able to get this product available to the public.Challenges:1: Getting Proper Funding2: Having A server that can Handle the Amount Of user using there Online Virtual Computer.3: Making a Proper Build That Can Handle the Users Usage.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830000970/science-space-and-amazing-coffee?ref=discovery_category_newest,1830000970/science-space-and-amazing-coffee," We all love coffee. In our project we want to create an ideal place for the full enjoyment of this drink. Incorporating, proprietary selection of coffee beans, new recipes, a handbook for the coffee lovers and the most interesting - Festival!The inspiration was the technical progress and the beauty of high technology. For our project, we chose a spacious place in one of the most beautiful streets in the city of Liepaja. The room is in a poor condition, but the combination of the workmen’s effort and your support we will create comfort and cosiness, which will be accompanied by a fireplace and sofas. We made a couple of sketches where you can see the approximate view of the amazing café.. We chose a completely new style for coffee shop – modern!After all, it's time to keep up with the times and create a fully futuristic cafe, thus the style of it will rely on technological minimalism. Notes of space charm, mixed with a homey feel, will give an atmosphere of total immersion into the cafe of the future. We want to use white as the dominant colour, the walls with bulging geometric shapes that will have LED backlighting. The combination of white walls will give a stunning visual effect. As well as the ceiling with a starry sky, which will give an opportunity to relax and dream in the evening.  Why do our cafe is special? Because almost all of the world's coffee shop in the same ""wooden"" style, and we want to start a new era, an era of technological progress! Implement in a cafe tablets for remote order, starry sky, academic events and more!Fantasy mixed with art and elegance.     Name it «CRYSTAL®». We want to create a very friendly place for people from different corners of the world, where, after walking on the beach at any time of the year they will be awaited by courteous staff with a cup of aromatic coffee. The city is full of standard coffee drinks options, such as black and white coffee, latte, cappuccino, espresso. So why not create a place which doesn’t just serve coffee drinks, but also works of art? We have come up with really delicious coffee recipes! Vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, cream, berries and nuts, syrups and cookies! As the main advantage of our project –is our own selection of coffee, for everyone! We would like to offer a variety of options, which are real coffee, decaffeinated and green coffee!  We have friends from Brazil, who gladly want to help us to find the secret of actually tasty coffee. We want to create a team, which will bel trying different options of roasted coffee beans, the desired pressure and the proportions of the preparation of the ideal coffee. We would also want to organise public tasting, which will allow people to try and choose the best option. After careful selection, three types of coffee beans will be created:  Also we have cosmically delicious recipes of muffins and cakes, so our cafe can boast those tasty treats, which we believe, absolutely everyone will enjoy.   Who does not love to eat, right?  Coffee can be ordered on the spot, as well as to take with you!We also offer a pouch of our coffee, attached to a gift for the investment.   According to the project plan, coffee beans CRYSTALLIS will be with different flavours (without using chemical additives):  The list will grow very fast!How will coffee get its flavour?  It's very simple; thanks to the evaporation of dried ingredients and mixing them with coffee beans and extract them in a vacuum. Modern café, unbelievably delicious coffee, what else can complete this place? We offer a «CRYSTAL® handbook of Coffee Lover»  In our team we have guys with great skills in journalism and our mutual dream is a comprehensive guide, containing all you need to know as a professional barista and everything that is needed to begin your journey in that field of cooking. The revolutionary handbook, containing all the information about the varieties of coffee, how to cook, creative recipes, tourist guides to places around the world where you can try wonderful coffee, and tips for children's drinks and treats. Also, it will contain a lot of useful information on how to make your own sweet syrup and in the proportions which are best to use in coffee.  We also want to release this book on the most popular languages of the world!  When the place for the daily enjoyment of coffee is ready, we decided to make the culmination of the entire project - Coffee Festival! («CRYSTAL Coffee Festival»)  The essence of the festival is to arrange a unique festival dedicated to coffee, where customers can taste new recipes and flavours.

In our project we want to create an ideal place for the full enjoyment of this drink. Incorporating, proprietary selection of coffee beans, new recipes, a handbook for the coffee lovers and the most interesting - Festival!The inspiration was the technical progress and the beauty of high technology. So this cafe will have big LCD screens on the ceiling to imitate space atmosphere! For our project, we chose a spacious place in one of the most beautiful streets in the city of Liepaja. The room is in a poor condition, but the combination of the workmen’s effort and your support we will create comfort and cosiness, which will be accompanied by a fireplace and sofas. We made a couple of sketches where you can see the approximate view of the amazing café.. We chose a completely new style for coffee shop – modern!In future we want to create this cafe in USA, UK, Germany, Italy and more...After all, it's time to keep up with the times and create a fully futuristic cafe, thus the style of it will rely on technological minimalism. Notes of space charm, mixed with a homey feel, will give an atmosphere of total immersion into the cafe of the future. We want to use white as the dominant colour, the walls with bulging geometric shapes that will have LED backlighting. The combination of white walls will give a stunning visual effect. As well as the ceiling with a starry sky, which will give an opportunity to relax and dream in the evening. Why do our cafe is special? Because almost all of the world's coffee shop in the same ""wooden"" style, and we want to start a new era, an era of technological progress! Implement in a cafe tablets for remote order, starry sky, academic events and more!Fantasy mixed with art and elegance. Name it «CRYSTAL®». We want to create a very friendly place for people from different corners of the world, where, after walking on the beach at any time of the year they will be awaited by courteous staff with a cup of aromatic coffee. The city is full of standard coffee drinks options, such as black and white coffee, latte, cappuccino, espresso. So why not create a place which doesn’t just serve coffee drinks, but also works of art? We have come up with really delicious coffee recipes! Vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, cream, berries and nuts, syrups and cookies! As the main advantage of our project –is our own selection of coffee, for everyone! We would like to offer a variety of options, which are real coffee, decaffeinated and green coffee!We have friends from Brazil, who gladly want to help us to find the secret of actually tasty coffee. We want to create a team, which will bel trying different options of roasted coffee beans, the desired pressure and the proportions of the preparation of the ideal coffee. We would also want to organise public tasting, which will allow people to try and choose the best option.After careful selection, three types of coffee beans will be created:Also we have cosmically delicious recipes of muffins and cakes, so our cafe can boast those tasty treats, which we believe, absolutely everyone will enjoy. Who does not love to eat, right? Coffee can be ordered on the spot, as well as to take with you! We also offer a pouch of our coffee, attached to a gift for the investment. According to the project plan, coffee beans CRYSTALLIS will be with different flavours (without using chemical additives):The list will grow very fast! How will coffee get its flavour? It's very simple; thanks to the evaporation of dried ingredients and mixing them with coffee beans and extract them in a vacuum. Modern café, unbelievably delicious coffee, what else can complete this place? We offer a «CRYSTAL® handbook of Coffee Lover» In our team we have guys with great skills in journalism and our mutual dream is a comprehensive guide, containing all you need to know as a professional barista and everything that is needed to begin your journey in that field of cooking. The revolutionary handbook, containing all the information about the varieties of coffee, how to cook, creative recipes, tourist guides to places around the world where you can try wonderful coffee, and tips for children's drinks and treats. Also, it will contain a lot of useful information on how to make your own sweet syrup and in the proportions which are best to use in coffee. We also want to release this book on the most popular languages of the world! When the place for the daily enjoyment of coffee is ready, we decided to make the culmination of the entire project - Coffee Festival! («CRYSTAL Coffee Festival») The essence of the festival is to arrange a unique festival dedicated to coffee, where customers can taste new recipes and flavours. There will be professional baristas who will teach everyone how to make a delicious drink and how to make patterns on the creamy foam .Accompanied by the live music and art performances, exhibition of images of the pattern on the coffee foams.

Since then tea seed was planted in her mind, she began her journey of refining her business model, observing the market and watching tea's north american market go through multiple waves. She knew early on that if she were going to build a company whose intentional business model would shift the way that we experience tea here, she needed to create a company with ethical and sustainable practices. As she dove into the rabbit hole of tea's history, she discovered that the results of colonization are still impacting the tea growing communities today and that consumerism in our society has blinded us from connecting with what's really happening.Up until the last 5 years, our experience of tea here Canada and the US has reflected some of the ugliest issues with our food industry over all. From a lack of transparency in our supply chain, a lack of education to our tea drinkers as to some of the major violations of human rights such as; sex & drug trafficking, inequality and modern day slavery. The way we see it, the flavour filled, added ingredient focus and sugar filled tea offerings we are so accustomed to here in NA is a reflection of our disconnect to teas being sourced ethically and sustainably.This challenge has resulted in us earnestly remodelling, redefining and refining our business model and our entry into the market. This paired with the perfect timing has been as intentional as making a cup of tea at the right temperature for the right time of infusion.

These battery packs utilize the latest battery cells which extend the life and functionality of your AIBO robot. We made it Plug-And-Play by custom 3D-Printing a case to house the new hardware and batteries which makes for easy access and replacement.In addition, we made an induction charging system that pairs with the new battery pack. This allows for AIBOs to function and play with a state-of-the-art battery management system.Visual Charging IndicatorThe visual charging indicator utilizes a LED light within the new battery pack system to show usage.Blinking Red indicates charge requiredBlinking Green indicates charge completeBlinking Red/Green indicates charging in processBlinking blue indicates normal function / no charge requiredThe AIBO robots, developed by Sony in the late 90s and early 2000s, was a great innovation in consumer robotics. They served as a fun toy primarily intended for adults due to its cost and fragility. However, be as it may, Sony shutdown the AIBO robotics division and support for them ceased in the mid 2000s. To this day the AIBO robots are functional but have mechanical and battery failures which SONY no longer supports.PrototypingWe successfully created working prototypes. One of the challenges that we've overcome was utilizing our own custom hardware without interrupting the normal functionality of AIBO.We designed and 3D-printed a case that fits the new hardware inside the existing compartment. From there we underwent vigorous tests measuring battery life degradation to ensure we wouldn't run into any existing or new problems with this prototype solution. We were met with great success and are excited to offer this as a viable battery pack solution for AIBO enthusiasts.Sony discontinued support for the AIBO and does not offer replacement parts or battery packs any longer. We've engineered our own battery pack replacement to keep AIBO in operation.These are the AIBO models we support:ERS-1 *Just Added!*ERS-210ERS-220ERS-311 *Just Added!*ERS-312*Just Added!*ERS-7We utilize a battery management system as the foundation for each battery pack that includes these highlighted features:What is induction charging?Induction charging uses an induction coil to create an alternating electromagnetic field from within a charging base. A second induction coil in the portable device takes power from the electromagnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the battery.We designed these battery packs to fit into the existing AIBO battery compartment.This battery pack replaces your old pack and utilizes the same charging system as the factory one supplied.This battery pack replaces your old pack and utilizes an induction charging station that we supply.Induction Charging StationERS 210/220 Battery Pack placement (induction charging case) ERS 3 Battery Pack placement (induction charging case)ERS 3 Battery Replacement WITH cover (non-induction charging)ERS 7 Battery Pack placement (induction charging case)ERS 7 Battery Replacement WITH cover (non-induction charging)Induction Charging UnitThe Induction Charging station is shown below:Operational ResultsWe put our battery packs to the test to ensure its functionality and reliability. The videos below show these results.ERS 210/220 OperatingERS 7 OperatingWe've invested our time and materials in R&D to design this battery pack and we need your support to infuse a new life for the AIBO robots. We have proven this alternative battery solution works and now we need your help with funding to begin manufacturing for all other AIBO users to enjoy.Andy Wagoner -Co-Founder / Business CommercializationA graduate from the University of Arizona, Eller College of Management with a Business Management Degree. Andy brings to the table the entrepreneurial experience in managing technological innovations from concepts to production with successful tech startups and commercialization experience. Andy leads a team of innovative engineers that actively push the envelope for technological solutions with professionalism and passion for design.Robert Wagoner -Co-Founder / Lead EngineerRobert is a Roboticist dating back to early 1978 when he made a replica R2D2 and continued to be part of many advanced Robotic teams around the world creating Educational, Hobby, Commercial and Military Robotic developments. He continues to innovate as an Aerospace engineer with UGV/UAS technologies for leading corporations. His AIBO passion started with the ERS-110 in 1998 and continued despite Sony ending manufacturing in 2006 with the ERS-7, then halting all support in 2012. As time went on, his need to self service repairs revealed that the ultimate failure would be the battery system. It was time to dive in and research what could be discovered and developed to solve this problem. After successful experimentation in 2015 with induction charging, the next step was to combine and update the battery pack replacement. With the success of several prototypes, it was time to engage the power of the people with this campaign to help save everyone's beloved robotic pets around the world.The helpful information shared by the AIBO community like Aibopet, Dogsbody, AiboRanch & WolfBob to name a few, is greatly appreciated.","ManufacturingThe ability to manufacture and deliver on time is just as important to us as the quality and innovative solution we are offering in this project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefoamgnome/the-foam-gnome-a-hand-washing-system-for-kids?ref=discovery_category_newest,thefoamgnome/the-foam-gnome-a-hand-washing-system-for-kids,"Hi, I’m Claire Godino, an infectious disease scientist and mother of two, and I’d like to tell you about my amazing new patent-pending product, The Foam Gnome. I noticed that even though I had taught my kids how to properly wash their hands, they would still cut corners and not wash the right way when they weren’t being watched. I started to think about what motivates children to do a good job and realized that coupling repetition with a sense of independence was a huge driving factor. The Foam Gnome system was born from my deep-rooted desire to help children stay healthy and to give parents a much needed break from constant monitoring.It is estimated that up to 80% of all infectious diseases are spread by dirty hands. These can include the common cold, the flu, strep throat, and even nasty stomach bugs - And let’s face it, whatever comes home with your child will often spread to one or more members of the household. This can result in missed days of school, work, and even lost wages that impact the entire family. Although most children do wash their hands, they don’t always do it the right way every time: They don't use soap, they don't scrub well or long enough, or they only wash their fingertips. This product aims to change these statistics by using an amusing and educational book to teach children how, when, and why it’s important to wash their hands and by using visual and audio cues in an interactive soap dispenser to engage their interest and offer a reward for a job well done. The Foam Gnome system will give them the confidence and independence to wash correctly every time.The book:Children are introduced to The Foam Gnomes when they encounter a dirty troll who has come from his cave by the lake to play with them. The gnomes turn him away because he is sticky and dirty and they’re afraid he’ll get them sick. This makes the troll very upset so the gnomes decide to teach him how to take care of himself. They show him how, when, and why he needs to wash his hands. The troll takes their advice and cleans himself. He joins the Foam Gnomes’ party and they are friends for life!The dispenser:When the top is pressed, the soap comes out from the tip of the Foam Gnome‘s hat. The gnome sings a 20-second song to encourage proper scrubbing time and then asks the child to rinse their hands. Then he says, “Show me your hands!” and his cheeks light up with glee!The Foam Gnome system can be a tremendous aid to child care centers who are seeking to obtain or maintain state accreditation for their facilities. Getting children excited about washing their hands can be critical to meeting and exceeding state criteria. Accreditation can let parents know that their child is attending a facility that goes the extra mile to keep their students safe and healthy. Let us help you achieve that goal!The Foam Gnome can also be implemented in pediatricians’ offices, urgent care facilities, and hospitals. There the book can remain in the lobby and the dispenser will stay in the restroom for use. This can help lower cross-contamination between sick patients and those who are there for check-ups or injuries.In order to get this product to you, we need your help. In its current state, the prototype is 3D printed and clipped around an off-the-shelf bottle. We’d like you to be able to use any type of foaming soap that you choose, so we need to create a refillable chamber of our own design inside the dispenser. We also need to make a few electrical changes like designing a custom printed circuit board and adding an integrated battery compartment. In order to do this, we need funding to help cover the cost of these changes. Once those changes are made, we’ll need to pay for tooling for parts that will allow us to use injection molding for factory production. This will speed up production and make a much nicer and more durable dispenser. Your support will also allow us to pay to create packaging for the system.This is a unique opportunity to help fund a product that will impact your health and the health of your loved ones. Please consider backing and sharing this project and together we can make the world a cleaner place!If we reach $150,000 we will offer a fully Spanish book and gnome. Si alcanzamos $150,000 ofreceremos un libro y gnomo en español.Should this campaign hit $350,000, we will work to develop a wall-mounted unit with identical interactive features for child- and health-care facilities that do not have counter-tops.","We are hopeful that everything will continue to run smoothly.  Quotes are in place for all of the engineering and packaging design that we need and we have a manufacturer lined up to begin tooling and producing as soon as the redesign is complete.  As with anything, these things take time.  Although we do not expect any delays or issues, sometimes life happens.

It’s no secret that children have a reputation for being germ spreaders. But my passion for children’s health and hygiene was ultimately magnified when my own son started attending daycare. He brought home everything, and both of us were always sick. Given that he was just a toddler at the time, I noticed that even though his teachers and I had taught him how to wash his hands properly, he would play at the sink when an adult wasn’t right next to him to help. Like every task I’ve ever taught him as a parent, I wanted him to do a good job on his own because he wanted to, not because I was telling him to. Like many other parents, I struggled through years of trying to find ways to teach and engage him, but ultimately it came down to me having to be with him every time to make sure that he did what he was supposed to do to keep himself, and me, healthy until he was old enough to do it on his own.A few years later, one of my colleagues at work was getting her M.P.H. and was writing her thesis on children’s handwashing education and statistics. I was shocked to see how little evolution had happened in the field of hygiene education since I was a child. Most of the things I encountered were posters that were either too complicated and boring for small children or they required a parent or teacher to constantly be engaged with them to ensure that their standards were being met. It was at that point that a light bulb went off, and I started brainstorming ideas to help improve the overall compliance and effectiveness of the education that was available to kids. There was nothing out there that really got their attention and held it, nothing that rewarded them in any way that felt like accountability, and absolutely nothing that encouraged children to wash independently.I started to think about what motivates children to do a good job and realized that mixing repetition with a sense of pride and independence was a great driving factor.The Foam Gnome system encourages children to do well because they want to, not because they’re being told to. The instructions are presented in a book that allows them to become invested in the characters and the reward system helps them to feel good about their achievements. This combination motivates the kids and give parents a much-needed break from constant monitoring.In order to get this product to you, we need your help.

Hence, our tagline; O.L.U.M. – the Occidental Lodge Of Underground Motoring...it denotes our San Francisco roots and the dedication to our mission.Our magazine is about the souls transported by the machines, not just the machines.The development of AUTOCULT #2...and your place on the boardAs a supporter of what we're doing with the magazine, you'll not only be rewarded with all the stuff listed off to the right there, but you'll automatically become a member of our special advisory board and be tapped for the development of not only story ideas, but maybe a character you think would make for a good feature or someone in your town you think deserves some recognition for their work and contributions to our culture. You'll be a valued member of the board and we look forward to a productive relationship – you're now part of a hard-working magazine!We're telling the stories of car culture that reach far beyond the cars.Our goalIf you help us to reach our goal, we'll use the funds to do a few things:• Finish the features we've already started, including travel, film costs, production expenses and feeding the animals. We always forget to feed the animals during a photoshoot.• Pre-press! Once we get our files prepared for the printing press, the process of turning digital data into the physical metal plates that ink runs across on the press is called CTP (or ""computer-to-plate""). A good pre-press tech is worth his/her weight in gold. GOLD, people. As in, ""not cheap.""• Once the switch is flipped on the press, the paper and the ink and the bindery and the palleting and any handwork that needs to be done before the trucks show up to deliver all those fresh copies of the magazine to the stores will be paid for.• Pay the shipper. Magazines printed right here, stateside, are still shipped from the press through centralized warehouses and then to the individual newsstands by truck. It's one of our larger expenses, since shipping costs are based on weight. And paper is heavy. • The tablet edition. We'll be launching the digital tablet edition of AUTOCULT with this issue. Exclusive images, video footage, behind-the-scenes stuff and a few extras that'll make it something really special. Car culture draws influence from all sorts of different disciplines.The staffDan Stoner launched AUTOCULT with its premiere issue, kicking off his second automotive cultural brand after founding GARAGE magazine in 2001. He lives in San Francisco, where his other full-time job is managing the six old car projects stuffed into one very small, rented garage that drive him to the living end. Morris Pittle has the greatest name in publishing. He's also heading up the marketing efforts of AUTOCULT, after founding and leading a full-service advertising agency for a decade. Mo can use phrases like ""non-endemic tastemakers"" without even snickering. And that's extremely awesome.Tom Hartle served as President of SPIN Magazine, co-founded 7x7 magazine, relaunched Hearst magazine and purchased California Home + Design magazine before leaving all that to launch BANDWDTH – a multimedia app publisher focused on the arts and sciences in 2010. Tom knows a few things about magazines and how apps work. Which we dig about him.","The biggest risk of this project is a delay in getting the final digital files to the printing press. Because a magazine like relies so heavily on contributing photographers, writers and subjects (real humans), there are a ton of moving parts that have to be managed And if there's one delay in getting promised materials (in whatever form they take) produced or delivered, it'll affect every other element and delay a press date. When that happens, we pivot: we find out immediately what the cause of the delay is, rectify it, and move along quickly. Hey, we've been doing this for more than a decade, so while we know better than to say, ""We've seen it all,"" we can definitely say, ""Nothing's shocking and we can fix that..."""

When they become an all digital process, we lost certain type of sci-fi world: the gritty “used-universes” like the ones seen in the original Alien, early Star Wars, and many others.In those worlds, everything felt different. You could believe a spaceship could travel across the galaxy because under the layers of grime, you could actually see the intricate details that powered it. And the characters felt like they were part of a real future world. They wore uniforms that weren’t a CG addition, and they could actually touch and interact their surroundings. In fact, these sci-fi worlds were real, created in a workshop. And because modern films have largely left that behind, it’s a universe that has little chance to be seen again on a grand scale.But we want to change that. And you can help resurrect a lost art form.ILM went all digital in 2005, but they left behind an incredible practical effects model making community here in San Rafael. Our experienced team is ready to work with them and other local pros to create one of those amazing worlds again, right here where those real-world techniques were perfected.We’ll create that classic working-class spaceship, flying cars, and other intricate machines and environments. A richly detailed world created with scale model and full-size fabricated materials.When you become a backer, you are automatically plugged in for an exclusive inside look at this rare process. We’ll post regular updates with pictures and video, so you can see how these worlds take shape. It's a style of filmmaking you won't be able to see anywhere else.Why is our price set where it’s at? Put simply, to make sure we can create the right amount of materials. We won’t just be creating a few token effects for the film. Our price is set at a level to make sure we can fabricate a large number of models and environments to make a fully immersive world. And we’ll explore new ways to stay true to the practical effects look at all times, and use modern digital filmmaking techniques to get more real-world visuals on the screen. We’ll be sure to use CG to enhance those classic techniques, not replace them. And we’ll explore new technologies like 3D Printing to open new possibilities in the model making process.Big Future’s story begins with Jet, a young girl phone hacker in 1981. After receiving a strange distress signal, she is transported to a future world where she must find the pilot who sent it. But the pilot’s disaster was no accident, and some very dangerous people want to stop her. Fortunately, Jet’s fascination with technology will help give her an edge, and a well-connected gangster (with one sweet ride) will lend her a hand, as long as she doesn’t trust him too far.Jet has found the exciting future she wants to live in, but will she survive it? It’s a thrilling journey as she travels to a floating city, confronts a hotshot pilot, and battles with some deadly enemies. All leading to a final showdown in machine-controlled corner of the future, where she’ll discover why she was chosen to be there in the first place.Big Future will be a one hour series pilot. A full adventure in a universe so comprehensive, we hope it will inspire further exploration into this kind of science fiction as a series.• Every reward level will receive regular video updates detailing the making of this rare form of filmmaking. A behind-the-scenes account of real world construction and on-set expertise that make it all come to life. • Every reward level above $15 gets a copy of the film as a digital download.• At higher levels, you'll be able to own some the epic images of the film with a collection of classic style Trading Cards, including the film's best moments, ship profiles, and concept art. And watch for the rare cards at the higher reward tiers.Some prototype reward designs:Producer: Martha Richter SmithMartha brings a wealth of production experience from effects and animation powerhouses ILM, ESC, Pixar and Disney.Her time at ILM includes the storied era when they still did practical effects.Martha has theunique experience and connectionsto bring a project like this together.Director: Mike BatesAfter being a cinematics director for intense video game franchises such as Call of Duty and Sony’s Resistance, Mike is looking forward to applying the same immersive and exciting vision to the world of classic practical effects films.VFX Supervisor: Carl Willat Long-time Bay Area commercial and effects director Carl Willat is well versed in the worlds of both CG and practical techniques. Carl was a VFX Supervisor on effects films such as Flubber and Walter Murch’s dark 80’s classic Return to Oz.Follow us on Twitter and Facebook!","It’s pretty simple. We want to make a great film using the classic special effects techniques that we all miss seeing. We have an extremely talented team with an amazing story and designs ready to go, all set at a price that will ensure sure we will deliver a fully immersive and entertaining film.So what’s the biggest challenge moving forward? Basically, it’s the fact that we will be using those classic practical techniques in a modern special effects environment. To see a classic look in a modern film, it takes non-standard ways of doing things on a film’s production. But we look forward to tackling that challenge head on. And that’s where you can make all the difference. By backing this project you are creating a solid way for us to meet that challenge. Not only with funding, but also with your vote. When you back Big Future, you are making a statement that there is an interest to see more real materials in movies, which in itself will open a lot of doors.

Our jumping off point is the Medieval period. Normally the music is added to the final result of the animation but in this case we chose to go the opposite way. We look at the classical music compositions as the foundation for the animation. The result is a purer form of music from the imagination of our composers. How we intend to use the funds:50% of the funds raised are for the animators. 30% is for the musicians and composers. 20% is for the sound design.LOOK AND FEELCinematic in feel, multilayered with deep perspective and colour palettes designed to evoke the musical timeframe, each Opus will feature a different style of animation, the musical arrangements being informed by the visuals - whimsical and immediately enjoyable. FORMAT The final video project will be 24fps, 2k (2048×1080) Cinema ‘flat’ (35mm widescreen) 1.85, 5.1 Surround Sound. EVENTSLIVE PERFORMANCE There will be live performances of pieces from the actual period in which the 'Dundercats' Opus is placed. These will be followed by the premiere for each Opus. Before the live performance there is a short lecture on the creative process and the team.THE STORYDeath, a tiny, shadowy figure, face hidden in his cloak of invisibility, travels across plague-ravaged European countryside. Passing through towns, claiming the lives of people he manages to grab by the mouth with his bony wee hands to peer down their throats and grab their souls. He walks slowly, deliberately along roads and through towns, upsetting birds and animals, making flowers and vegetables wither and die at his very presence.Death approaches the town of Kittenwald, a beautiful town in the Bavarian Alps with magnificently decorated houses, painted facades and ornately carved gables. Known as ""the Village of a Thousand Strings"" because of the Citoles, Viols, Lutes and Gitterns lovingly made here, all of its citizens are happily involved in the artistry of creating beautiful musical instruments.Death theatrically and ominously brandishes a wooden staff topped with a sharp metal blade shaped like a cat claw as he walks by streets full of luthier shops.Death walks by Charlie and Ollie’s luthier. Charlie completes stringing a Viol whilst Ollie, waiting patiently for her, quietly wraps a Sackbut and lute in cloth. He lifts up a picnic basket and motions for Charlie to leave through the back door for supper. They escape Death’s notice by mere seconds.Meanwhile, Death’s feet are killing him. A tiny yawn issues from the darkness under his cloak where his face should be. Lips smacks follow the yawns. Death needs a nap. Death heads over to a gnarly old tree. The tree immediately dies as he curls up under it. He makes noises as he sleeps. A mixture of snoring and purring.Ollie and Charlie set off towards an old churchyard a short walk from home. A few minutes into the walk, Charlie realises that she has forgotten the blanket and looks around for anything that can be used as a substitute. She sees a long, grey cloak beneath the branch of an old, gnarly old dead tree and picks it up, feeling very pleased with herself. She does not notice Death sleeping under the branch.They reach the churchyard and enjoy their picnic.The lack of a cloak rouses Death. He’s a bit chilled. He’s stiff and irritated. He returns to Kittenwald to finish his day's work, unaware that his cloak is missing and that everyone can now see him.Death points his staff at people and hisses. He is not frightening in the least, but rather a ridiculous and comical figure - a teeny, hairless, wrinkly cat. The citizens of Kittenwald look at him and point and laugh, as though he were the village idiot.Death is thoroughly confused and embarrassed then realises that he has no powers at all without his cloak. He flees from the town amid peals of laughter. Running right past Ollie and Charlie returning from their picnic.Ollie carries the basket, Charlie drapes Death's cloak over her paw. The Mayor of the town recognises the cloak as Death's and soon Charlie and Ollie are being held aloft and paraded through the town as the vanquishers of Death, the saviours of the Village of a Thousand Strings. Ollie passes biscuits to Charlie as they are carried through the streets. They munch and laugh.","Our animation partners are based in Poland, so our challenges are timezones and geographic location. To facilitate our work we use SaaS products Slack (@SlackHQ) and Wipster (@wipsters) to push the creative process of turning the music into animation. We also rely on Skype (@skype) for face-to-face communications.We are professional musicians and TV producers/editors and sound designers working with professional animators so we are very used to the workflows, schedules, intense deadlines that these kinds of projects bring.  After the Medieval opus is finished, we will move on to the next opus There are seven opuses spanning 900 years of Western classical music history. With your support we can achieve our goal of bringing a totally unique music and animation project to the public, showing the concerts in three venues; Canada, Scotland and Hong Kong."

All other VR devices that meet the requirements of motion detection and wireless interface are not currently supported as of yet.What we need:We are putting together a Wireless controller which will have an on-board Allwinner Ultra-Octa A80 processor 8 Core CPU,PowerVR G6230 GPU 64 Core GPU, 2GB DDR3, 8GB EMMC, WIFI/BT4.0 , 1 HDMI in-port/out-port, and 1x USB type C.G3T Liv3 Controller VR GPU Specs:Video: 3840x1080 at 30fps 3D codec, support BD/SBS/TAB/FP formatSupirior high-definition video processingA80 processor supports 4096*2048 at 30fps video playback，4096*2048 at 30fps video coding.We will build 500 of these devices for our White Umbrella Members only, and we will accept orders for the G3T Liv3 mobile cloud console when the obligation to our White Umbrella Members are met.All members may choose a custom pattern and or color for their controller.We have to perfect the web-based streaming quality and complete the Modified Story Scenario for Resident Evil / Biohazard 7 known as ""The Last Biohazard"". The G3T Liv3 service will be free to play demo games and free for our Mods.The G3T LiV3 controller GeTroller will be available on the market next year when our Kick-starter meets its goal.With or without the AfterGlow controller, the web-based PlayStation 4 client connects to the G3T LiV3 Server via the Samsung Galaxy S 6 Sprint LTE Internet which was a bit unstable during this test.This is the Resident Evil 7 Beginning Hour Demo Online for all devices. We are pending the official release which we are currently beta testing.Feature:4 play Co-Op mode regardless of the Game System.

Since most people have moved pass the bulky and clunky CRT’s TVsets and on to today’s HDTV sets, you know the video quality is not as goodwhen compared to CRT’s using the standard composite video or even rf. TheComponentVideoBox isthe device you've been waiting for. The Component Video Boxis a box that can be easily connects to classic gaming consoles, such theturbografx-16, Super Nintendo, etc. allowing for amazing video quality in today’sHDTV sets in 240p/288p resolution in component (YPbPr) video. This is will onlywork in current HDTV sets that supports 240p/288p. The box have been confirmedto worked for the following systems:1.Turbografx-16/PC-Engine (including the PC-Engine LT) 2. Super Nintendo/SuperFamicom 3. Sega Genesis/MegaDrive (all models including the Nomad and CDX)4. Sega Master System 5. OriginalNintendo/Famicom system (must be already RGB modded) The box should also workwith the Neo Geo AES system but I have not tested with one since I do not own aNeo Geo AES system. The box will also work with the turbo duo and pce duo systemswith a slight modification to the consoles with din8 connectors to carry theRGB signals (stock is din 5 connector).How do it work??Most classic gamingsystems already output RGB (the purest video signals) natively with the exceptionof the NES.The component video boxutilize a custom designed circuit that takes the RGB signals, amplify them andmix them into component (YPbPr) video using only discrete semiconductorcomponents for live component video encoding process with zero lag.",The component video box only works right now when one system is connected to it.  It does not work when more then one systems are hooked up it.  One of the main challenge will be getting it to work with all system hooked up to it.  The other challenge is sourcing all cables for the different systems.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1845713947/the-retroclarity-component-ypbpr-video-adaptor?ref=discovery_category_newest,1845713947/the-retroclarity-component-ypbpr-video-adaptor,"If you’ve played your classic game consoles on a modern HDTV, you’ve surely noticed that the video quality isn’t as good as you remember it. Poor picture quality is an inherent problem with connecting old consoles to new TVs. These gaming systems were designed to look beautiful on CRT TVs - the kind we all had in the ‘80s and ‘90s - but need a few tweaks to look great on a modern TV. That’s why we’ve made the RetroClarity. It’s a simple plug-and-play solution that allows you to connect your classic consoles to a high-definition TV without sacrificing video quality. Simple and easy to use: You can use the RetroClarity on many of your favorite classic gaming consoles, like the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Turbografx-16. It provides amazing video quality presented on today's HDTV sets in 240p(NTSC)/288p(PAL) standard definition resolution in component (YPbPr) video. (Please note: The RetroClarity will only work with HDTVs that support 240p(NTSC)/288p(PAL) resolution and all CRTs with component video inputs)The RetroClarity is compatible with the following systems:●	Turbografx-16/PC-Engine (Including the PC-Engine LT)●	Super Nintendo/Super Famicom (All versions of the Model 1)●	Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (All models including Genesis Model 2, the Nomad, CDX and JVC X’Eye)●	Sega Master System●	The RetroClarity should also work with the Neo Geo AES but it has yet to be tested with the system. Also compatible with the following systems with modification to the console:●	NES/Famicom (Requires an internal complex modification to output RGB signals)●	Turbo Duo/PC Engine Duo (Requires a slight modification to the console with DIN-8 connectors to carry the RGB signals)●	Super Nintendo/Super Famicom model 2 (Requires a slight modification on the console’s A/V port to carry the RGB signals)●	Nintendo64 (serial starting with NS1 for US & serial NUJ1 for JPN) with the VDC-NUS chip (Requires a rgb amp installed and modification on the console’s A/V port to carry the RGB signals)How does the RetroClarity work?Most classic gaming systems already produce RGB (the purest video signal) natively. The RetroClarity uses a custom-designed circuit to amplify and mix that RGB signal into component (YPbPr) video using only discrete semiconductor components for live component video encoding process. The best part? There’s ZERO lag. Video of composite vs component using our version 1 rgb to component board. (Courtesy of SensatoKuro)How to test to see if your HDTV set supports 240p(NTSC)/288p(PAL) resolution:Our goal is to mass produce the first limited production run of the RetroClarity devices.We will offer three versions of the RetroClarity: ●	Version 1 will support two systems simultaneously connected, but does NOT support the TurboGrafx-16 or PC-Engine●	Version 2 will support three systems simultaneously connected, but does NOT support the Turbografx-16 or PC-Engine●	RetroClarity Turbo will support three systems simultaneously connected with Turbografx-16/PC-Engine supportWith your help, we can obtain the funds needed to get these devices mass produced and into your home.

We can achieve this with either mini DIN-8 connectors or with SCART connectors. The mini DIN-8 fits best in the box we have already chosen, but it will be a tight fit for a SCART connector.2) The second challenge is choosing the best cable options to use with the RetroClarity devices. We have two options: We could use RGB to SCART cables or build our own custom cables. If we go with the RGB to SCART cables, we will need to source an adapter for SCART to mini DIN-8 which will add cost. If we build our own cables, there will be labor cost and additional production time."

I'm actually treated with a lot of respect here, and so is my wife but starting a company is very hard. I'm looking to make my magazine like any of those other normal jobs in a small town like butcher, baker, shoe salesman, cell phone vendor, pastry chef, pizzeria, nick-knack store owner.I was able to advertise on Facebook and Instagram for three days and receive well above average activity for my posts and publications with an incredible amount of interactivity and engagement from the area of the Sabana Centro and neighboring communities like Bogotá. I hate to say Bogotá, it's terrible for advertising, I wish there was a disclaimer to put before I said it; just keep in mind that with my magazine I'm trying to make the Sabana Centro of Colombia, which includes the Milla de Oro, it's own prospective place.I'm trying to legalize the magazine now as a SAS and then return to the States to set up Advetual as the LLC to connect the two to create an app for the area. There is a future of moving from Windows 10 to Ubuntu in order to create a platform where those in the valley can contribute to the information available about the area to share with any people entering the Sabana Centro for leisure, pleasure, family, or considering investment.This magazine is ahead of its time for Colombia. Most people are geared towards Facebook and Instagram here. The magazine is able to grab their attention from those media channels and direct them oftentimes for an hour to the digital magazine and website where they can then easily return to those sites to like and share and carry on. Most of my readers return to a single magazine three times. Some of my readers have been to my website over a dozen times.I'm able to count the number of pages in the magazine that readers read and that number is steadily increasing. Because I have interactive text, it is important for me to measure how many people scroll to the bottom of my pages and a majority do; meaning they are reading the magazine. I write about whatever inspires me. I try to push the limits with my writing, freely expressing without hesitation my deepest desires to be liberated from constraint going beyond literary freedom. Making the unbelievable, believable. I want to go well beyond what some may consider crazy and get down in writing why things don't make sense. I talk about tempting Jesus with beer because it is the year 2018, 18 being the legal age to tender your resignation to innocence in many countries. I write about men staying at home as the new trend in work, I have political views, bitcoin, and I focus most of my articles back on the community and how they make me feel. Even though I dare not ride a pink cloud in Colombia, there is a part of me that is constantly filled with excitement, deep spiritual needs being met, and a thirst for flavor that is only available in the Sabana Centro.With the little advertising I did do, I could feel the electricity around me as I went out into town knowing 30,000 of my neighbors saw my publication. It was a real buzz. I've promised my prospective clients to use their money to continue to promote their ads in my magazine through my magazine on social media to incorporate their target market. I know this will cause a huge roar around me as I walk down the street. There is already a lot of emotion around me when I walk outside, where people are digging to figure out how this big, white foreigner can still be here in a small town not going into the big city every day to make money. They are completely supportive and I've broken through so many barriers and even religious stigmas that I'm really a force. AC Grindl is a one man band. Creating, designing, organizing, framing, retouching, programming, posting, publishing, marketing, advertising, analyzing, developing all in a single effort Milla de Oro Magazine.My motto for the magazine is to be involved because it's the richness of life. My house, my neighborhood, my town, my valley is where I feel the most involved. I'm bringing the magazine to my readers so they can come together and have hope that someone is trying to do the best they can at all times in front of everybody.Please look at the website MilladeoroMagazine.com before you say no. See how companies like BopDesign are asking me for quotes, look at my social media channels connected with Milla de Oro Magazine like Twitter and the Instagram company profiles. Take a look at my digital business card. Yes, even that is digital and the community here in the Sabana Centro have found this as a true blessing. I also have one of the best Facebook pages around with MdeOmag.In case you didn't know Milla de Oro means Golden Mile. My magazine is named after the stretch of highway running from the Castillo Marroquín to my little town Cajicá. I was one of the first people to hear the slang terminology used to describe the highway, I caught on real quick, and was hit very eagerly to create an all new type of magazine, different than anything out there, and named it after the Golden Mile.","The challenge here is if clients will start to respect me with the contributions made through Kickstarter. I'm fully trustworthy.  I believe in myself more than anybody.  I know who I am.  It's difficult for people to see me through their own eyes because that is not how I see myself.  I know what I'm worth, I know what the magazine is worth.  For many people, they tell me I'm not shooting for the stars, that's all right with me. I will continue on with the magazine.  I want MdeO to work, I think it is good for so many people.  I'm trying my best to fulfill people's needs with my magazine.  I can offer more with more.The magazine is an organic process.  Little changes have to be made to everything every month; for speed, readability, usability, and social engagement.  Making these changes takes a lot of work and a lot of patience and know how to make things better.  It's a lot of work to get better everyday.  It's not fast and things have to be taken in stride.  Meeting the desires of clients who now know they can offer so much more to their users of their services is a task that I'm only prepared to do so with as much freedom as I have to exercise my pocket book.Wanting to invest more in my magazine is a true desire of mine.  The value of my digital goods can easily be seen in the quality of the publication.  Providing more top quality video production and photos as well as more content from experienced writers and business owners will boost the presence of the magazine.  Making these strides is only hindered by my own two feet.  The better I am able to organize, and fund my own needs, will directly determine the output that I can produce.I'm fully capable of continuing on without funding.  My desire to is to gain more trust from my social equals to that I can instill confidence in them that my abilities are a source of intention for inspiration."

The lightning was from the angle’s light ball which can be lighten up. An ugly green giant named Raamsoon own an axe that he took as his weapon. He always tried to thrown his axe to Mekhala, the angle. Mekhala enjoyed with it because she liked to play the prank with him.  They both always have their fight up on the sky and that's the beginning of this trouble. In the human word, Present day Raamsoon reborn in the form of human named “Ram” Who is the tramp,  Homeless and tried so hard to be invisible from the world, to hide his secret which make him Different from others.He hide his iron axe on his right hand, the magic weapon of Raamsoon. The axe that can beat every weapons on earth. The strangest thing was his age , Now he’s almost 200 years old but he doesn’t look that old. In fact, He look like 35 years old man. All of his friends and partners had passed away for long times. He left everything behind and live the new life with the name “Ram” He prefer to lived alone and but still asking for the point of his reborn. His only wish was the death  but it's absolutely so hard for him. According to his special power, He can heal his own wound Immediately and fast. Moreover, He was durable with every conditions such as drown himself, Suffocate.He can survived from every toughest conditions even though he tried to jump out from the 10th towers because of his immortality. He had been suffered from the love with Mekhala for years. He’s waiting for the moment that The light ball would fallen down from the heaven Which would be the sign for their forgiveness in case that they both had against the law for their forbidden love. In the mean time nearly midnight, Something happened with Sallee , 20 years old woman.  Her body has light up which is the sign for the rise of the light ball, It’s the same time That Ram and all the devil start to looking for that light ball to reborn again.  Thepsila, Raamsoon’s enemy had come in the form of human with  the quest to find the light ball for his almighty. This is the holy battle which only happen every 100 years according to the change of the heaven that need to find the new ruler.  The one who owned the light ball will get the chance to be  the next ruler of heaven.Ram had faced with the devil and Thepsila  This is the battle that will change the heaven for hundred years. had received an honor invited to Jackie Chan Action Movie Week, 1st. along with a lot of Action movie from international.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/easyvtol/monophan-thrust-vectoring-single-edf-vtol-transfor?ref=discovery_category_newest,easyvtol/monophan-thrust-vectoring-single-edf-vtol-transfor,"This concept was not developed to compete with multirotors, airplanes, helicopters or any other existing flight system. Obviously it will have advantages and disadvantages compared to other systems. However, the technology is too new to come to certain conclusions regarding capabilities. It has not yet been worked on by the engineering teams which have been working on the existing systems for decades now.It is simply a different way of achieving versatile flight capabilities. To provide a better understanding of this concept, we need to look at where the technology is today and what the future looks like.Past and TodayThe core idea of the MonoPhan was to provide sophisticated flight capabilities to any ducted fan itself or to the flight vehicle that the ducted fan is attached to. The target was to achieve this result without the need of conventional control surfaces such as ailerons, rudders, etc..., via a 3D thrust control module, which can control pitch, roll and yaw. The concept would require the same navigation system (3D thrust control module) be able to control horizontal and vertical flight and, if necessary use multiple units for handling more sophisticated needs.As you will see in my video, after long time of testing the first positive results were achieved in stabilizing the unit. Soon after, with design improvements, it became a very competent vertical flyer, also capable of semi horizontal high speed flight with amazing maneuvering capabilities. Further improvements in design and variable flight controller algorithms enabled transitioning to horizontal flight.Currently all MonoPhan units are using a unique 3 nozzle split thrust vectoring system for 3D thrust vectoring. There are two types of MonoPhans based on their capabilities.1-	Base units which are built for vertical and semi horizontal flight. These units are very agile with high maneuverability and can be used as camera platforms. These units will form the base for the modular concept, where multiple units will act together or solo to perform missions.2-	Advanced units which can transform to horizontal flight. These units use a unique variable angle flight controller platform, which enables a low cost solution to transitioning to horizontal flight. The same mechanism that adjusts the flight controller angle is used to transform the aerodynamic structure of the vehicle to create lift in horizontal flight. These units are perfect as camera platforms, as well as fun flying. In the future the transforming units will be used in advanced aerial robotics projects, performing missions either solo or in cooperation with other MonoPhan units. MonoPhan is beyond the concept of VTOL. VTOL flying machines can take off and land vertically and fly just like any other airplane. However, this doesn't mean that they are as capable in vertical flight as vertical flight machines, such as a helicopter. Therefore, transforming MonoPhan units are designed to perform vertical and horizontal flight equally well. FutureThe future of MonoPhan lies in a successful integration with robotics. Soon, we will start seeing autonomous MonoPhan units. The numerous advantages offered by this technology, such as safety, compact size, ability to reach high speeds and versatility, will provide a perfect platform where nano and real life size units will be able perform rescue missions, aerial photography, law enforcement missions. However, the real revolution will be achieved when advanced MonoPhan units will start operating in co-operation. The advanced units will enable multiple missions or single missions more effectively with the co-operation of multiple units. These missions may vary from rescue missions, where the speed of a transforming unit is needed to reach the rescue area, to missions which require the ability of entering tight spaces, safely, without the risk of causing injuries by exposed props, etc. Combining and detaching multiple units in the air, based on the needs of the particular mission, will also lead the way to the first real flying robots to perform sophisticated missions airborne. There is much more MonoPhan technology can deliver: making modular flying devices. As mentioned earlier, every 3D thrust vectoring unit is capable of powering/navigating vertical or horizontal flight. This will enable field missions with a lighter equipment, as one propulsion/navigation unit (ducted fan with 3D thrust vectoring system) will power all flight devices in your field mission box. I therefore have all the reasons to believe that the MonoPhan technology can consequently improve versatile flight capacities and the way we use them. The ProjectThe aim of this project is to manufacture low cost MonoPhan units with higher efficiency and optimization: 1- Transforming units: These units will use the unique variable angle flight controller concept with transforming aerodynamic properties, to provide superb handling, agility and versatile vertical and horizontal flight capabilities. Besides, theplatform that the flight controller is on, being level all times, is a perfect platform for aerial cameras.These units will range from 64mm to 90mm fan size. 2- Non-Transforming units: These units will provide a great solution to the need for safe, compact andversatile drones, both nano and larger (From 30mm to 64mm). These units will form the base for thefuture of aerial robotics. 3- Modular Propulsion/navigation units with matching horizontal and vertical flight bodies: Thepropulsion/navigation units will possess all navigational and control functions. The horizontal andvertical flight bodies will house the battery and provide the aerodynamic structure to enable the type offlight required. The propulsion/navigation unit will have easy programming capability to fit the differentflight bodies. One flight body will be powered and navigated by one or more propulsion/navigationunits. Raised funds will be used for further research and development, improving the design and manufacturing and distributing an initial batch of MonoPhan units. According to plans, the first batch can be in the market no later than second quarter 2017. Below is a rough projection of how the funds will be allocated:10,000.00.- FILL REWARDS  15,000.00.- MANUFACTURING OPTIONS RESEARCH/INITIAL MANUFACTURING COSTS/FINALIZING PATENT APPLICATONS5,000.00.- 	FURTHER R&D COSTS 5,000.00.- 	IMPROVING PRODUCT DESIGN FOR MASS PRODUCTION AND HIGHER COMMERCIAL VALUE 10,000.00.- 	MARKETING COSTS65,000.00.- FIRST BATCH MANUFACTURING COSTS 5,000.00.- 	SHIPPING/DISTRIBUTING 10,000.00.- 	KICKSTARTER COSTKind Regards,","I am a full time finance professional. So, the biggest challenge will be time management. However, I have taken place in many time sensitive large projects and therefore know that anything is possible with good planning.All of my designs are patent pending. This being said, there will be revisions and additions to some designs which will need to be submitted, along with completing the existing patent submissions.Success of this project depends on highlighting the strengths of this concept. Safety, compact design, ability to reach high speeds, cool factor and modular design, which I believe will revolutionize how we look at aerial robotics, are some of these advantages. Utilizing and making the most of these advantages will require professional support in making some design improvements and designing marketing campaigns.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/easyvtol/easyvtol-watcher-fpv-drone?ref=discovery_category_newest,easyvtol/easyvtol-watcher-fpv-drone,"Below video provides a simultaneous ground cam & onboard FPV cam view.EasyVTOL is a versatile VTOL drone design which can be very small and light, in fact under 250 grams, which eliminates the FAA regulations which have been imposed and the new ones which are on the way. It can also be scaled up to larger professional units.The ""Easy"" part comes from the ease of VTOL transition. In fact, the transition is built in to the genes of this unit. Because it is not and airplane that can hover, or it is not a unit which has been designed for only vertical flight. It was built to transition to an airplane every time you push the control (pitch) stick forward, and back to hover when you release it, and it does it very easily. This unique patent pending design features a one of a kind thrust vectoring system working in harmony with active wings and flight controller to make a pretty sophisticated job easy.Besides offering an amazing and unique flight experience, the EasyVTOL capability also offers some advantages such as improved efficiency when travelling longer distances and giving the pilot the ability to focus on the mission on a stop and go mission. One can also fly the unit at low speeds without fully transitioning to horizontal flight, thus providing a unique aerial video and FPV experience. I have created this design with search and rescue in mind. And in the future hoping to create larger professional units which can be used to save lives.My initial goal with this project is to create DIY kits and ready to fly units of my 250g EasyVTOL unit. This unit is fully constructed of foam board which makes it easy to build, light and low cost.Thank you!Some History For the Curious Bunch!- Earlier Prototypes that led to this finalized design- Initial tests and crash compilation:) No good thing comes easy! Many design improvements and field tests were completed to perfect the design and tune the unit.","The design and tests have been completed and I have lots of experience developing new ways of flight and new designs, as well as fine tuning and refining them. I don't see any major challenges to launch a product except the complications caused by the pandemic that we are currently going through."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robingrace/me-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,robingrace/me-2,"Why did I create MEI had a choice to take my own lifeME is a safety first social networking app that connects young people in a meaningful way with the people who care most about them, particularly in a time of need. People, and particularly children and young people, need to know how to respond to a situation when things go wrong and how and where to get help and support. ME is educational, fun and most importantly, practical. It will give parents peace of mind that their children can access the supports they need in a crisis while at the same time ensuring that the young person has the freedom to explore the internet without being monitored or controlled. Monitoring and controlling online behavior without consent can break a trusting relationship and make it more difficult for a young person to seek help from the person that is trying to control them. Trust ME, and allow young people to become better decision makers and support them when they need it.ME will be free to downloadME will have No subscription of any kindAndME will have no advertising. Of any kind. EVER!ME provides easy to understand esafety and tech literacy education for young people that is solution based in terms of keeping people safe. The education will be a mix of illustrations, animations/moving image, text and audio to suit all learning styles.4-Step StrategyOnce the user engages with the education they will have the choice in how they want to respond. By adopting a simple 4-step strategy, akin to the safe-cross code, ME will make social media a safer more enjoyable environment for everyone. Step 1) recognize the dangers through age appropriate education. Step 2) Take a break when and if you need to Step 3) Connect with someone in your support network and step 4) build your confidence and resilience by engaging with a pro-social (eg sporting/outdoor activity) which will using geo linking. These steps can be applied to any dangerous or risky scenario that a young person may encounter as a positive response, and if the person needs to seek further assistance or advice ME will provide links to professional support services in their locality.Integration of AI (Artificial Intelligence)ME will also use AI to better understand how the user responds and can prompt them in a more useful way.Photo-Sharing GalleryME app will have a private photo gallery call ‘Me and You’. Users of the ME app can share photos with each other and attach a message to each photo but once the user sends or receives a photo the photo is static only to be enjoyed by the user in their gallery. This gallery will serve as a log of good times spent with family and friends and will re-enforce the importance of time spent with loved ones.Social ChangeME is a social movement that will affect positive social change. We can all respond in a positive way rather than react.Through my personal and professional experiences, I developed this strategy to mind myself and my wellbeing. Recognizing the risks and dangers personal to me, taking a break from social media when there were aspects of my engagement that were harmful to me. (As one wise man once told me, ‘it you don’t have to look at something that you know might harm you, then don’t, because you can never un-see it.) Taking the time to connect with friends and family and replacing the bad stuff with things like sport and music. All of these things combined ensured I was better able to respond to negative situations online. But the most important thing in all of this was, it was my choice!DEMOME is at demo stage and a sample user case can be seen below.

People, and particularly children and young people, need to know how to respond to a situation when things go wrong and how and where to get help and support. ME is educational, fun and most importantly, practical. It will give parents peace of mind that their children can access the supports they need in a crisis while at the same time ensuring that the young person has the freedom to explore the internet without being monitored or controlled. Monitoring and controlling online behavior without consent can break a trusting relationship and make it more difficult for a young person to seek help from the person that is trying to control them. Trust ME, and allow young people to become better decision makers and support them when they need it.ME will be free to downloadME will have No subscription of any kindAndME will have no advertising. Of any kind. EVER!ME provides easy to understand esafety and tech literacy education for young people that is solution based in terms of keeping people safe. The education will be a mix of illustrations, animations/moving image, text and audio to suit all learning styles.4-Step StrategyOnce the user engages with the education they will have the choice in how they want to respond. By adopting a simple 4-step strategy, akin to the safe-cross code, ME will make social media a safer more enjoyable environment for everyone. Step 1) recognize the dangers through age appropriate education. Step 2) Take a break when and if you need to Step 3) Connect with someone in your support network and step 4) build your confidence and resilience by engaging with a pro-social (eg sporting/outdoor activity) which will using geo linking. These steps can be applied to any dangerous or risky scenario that a young person may encounter as a positive response, and if the person needs to seek further assistance or advice ME will provide links to professional support services in their locality.Integration of AI (Artificial Intelligence)ME will also use AI to better understand how the user responds and can prompt them in a more useful way.Photo-Sharing GalleryME app will have a private photo gallery call ‘Me and You’. Users of the ME app can share photos with each other and attach a message to each photo but once the user sends or receives a photo the photo is static only to be enjoyed by the user in their gallery. This gallery will serve as a log of good times spent with family and friends and will re-enforce the importance of time spent with loved ones.Social ChangeME is a social movement that will affect positive social change. We can all respond in a positive way rather than react.Through my personal and professional experiences, I developed this strategy to mind myself and my wellbeing. Recognizing the risks and dangers personal to me, taking a break from social media when there were aspects of my engagement that were harmful to me. (As one wise man once told me, ‘it you don’t have to look at something that you know might harm you, then don’t, because you can never un-see it.) Taking the time to connect with friends and family and replacing the bad stuff with things like sport and music. All of these things combined ensured I was better able to respond to negative situations online.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/biomechrg/nu-hand-the-innovative-3d-printed-hand?ref=discovery_category_newest,biomechrg/nu-hand-the-innovative-3d-printed-hand,"Update 3 Video:Introducing the Nu Hand: Biomechanical Robotics Group was founded with the vision of creating lower cost and highly functional prosthetic solutions for a large community of users.We have developed the Nu Hand 3D printed hand prototype as a first step in fulfilling our vision. The Nu Hand is designed to address key needs and concerns in the amputee community and beyond with regard to practical, functional, affordable, and aesthetically pleasing prosthetic solutions.Why are we doing this? This project is a culmination of my desire to use my engineering skills and biomedical education to benefit the world at large. I have known amputees personally, which has given me a glimpse into the challenges they face. I conceived of the Nu Hand as a way to make an immediate impact for the millions of people in the growing amputee community (a population expected to nearly double by 2050 in the U.S. alone due to longer life spans, vascular diseases such as diabetes, etc). In pursuit of this vision, I founded the Biomechanical Robotics Group around a team of individuals that share this same mindset of innovation in the emergent market of 3D printed prostheses.  -Tim ChungBRG Founder and CEO-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Market Challenges:Currently, hand/arm prostheses suffer an imbalance between these areas:Functionality - Affordability - AestheticsFunctionality: There are robotic prostheses that are highly functional but are restricted in terms of affordability and appearance. Affordability:3D - printed prostheses can range from DIY ~$50 - $500 (or more), but tend to be lacking in functionality and appearance. Traditional hand prostheses can cost $10,000 to $50,000 or more.Aesthetics: There are purely cosmetic prosthesis that provide no functionality and are still relatively expensive (~$10,000). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How is this unique?      Our company aims to address these imbalances by creating a product that is functional for a broad range of real-world tasks (activities of daily living), more life-like in appearance, and affordable.Functionality:  We have taken the lessons learned from 1st generation 3D printed prostheses and are working on improving the replication of human anatomical motion.Affordability:   We have taken the approach that 3D printing allows for cost-effective maintenance and of replacement of worn or, in the unique case of children, out-grown parts.   Our company philosophy is to provide affordability for the life of our product. Aesthetics:  Using proprietary algorithms developed in house, we can closely match a client's hand/finger size quickly and easily without using expensive 3D scans.  We have also designed a hand that closely mimics a more natural range of motion than many competing solutions. In addition, we have also thought about individuals who may not have hand size information available. Anthropometry is a field that measures proportions of the human body. Using anthropometric data points (available through the CDC) we will be able to estimate hand dimensions (hand length, finger length, hand span, etc) by their frame size, height, and weight. What is the Nu Hand?  The Nu Hand is an advanced 3D printed prosthetic hand prototype that we are working on and would like Kickstarter backing to develop further.  The Nu Hand design more closely mimics natural movement, has replaceable components, will have rigorous engineering tests performed on it (durability and failure tests) and can be size matched to anyone.   A reality shared by all prosthetic devices is that with the wear and tear of normal use, they will eventually fail. With that in mind, a key feature of the Nu Hand solution is a completely modular chassis. The modular chassis design means that users with access to a basic set of tools will be able to easily replace components as needed without the wait times often faced with traditional prosthetic repairs. How does it work? The Nu Hand is designed to mimic the complex mechanisms found in human hands with simple solutions to deliver practical mobility and functionality. Muscles that pull (never push) drive human hand motion naturally.  We demonstrated the Nu Hand solution in the introduction video (see above); creating a closed fist by pulling the clear 'tendons'.  The Nu Hand will have elastic bands on the backs of the fingers allowing them to return to their original relaxed position after the 'tendons' release.  This provides stability to the joint while closing (in real life, there are many bundles of muscles and tissue supporting each finger and joints). We have allowed the fingers to have side-to-side (lateral) movement.  This provides a means for a user to splay their fingers naturally for additional support or personal expression the way a human hand can naturally.  A servo motor will be used to move each individual finger laterally (we hope to demonstrate this feature in an update to backers soon after project funding is complete).  Concurrently, we are in the process of developing a drive system with the goal of closing individual fingers with one motor. This is a unique approach as it would be much easier to drive the hand with five motors (something we plan to do during the next stage development). However, we feel that the benefit of using fewer motors will allow the Nu Hand to have longer battery life and be lighter weight. The Nu Hand will be using muscle sensors that are available on the market to drive motion. Muscle sensors are well established and are able to provide signals to a micro-controller to tell a finger to move.  However, we understand that some individuals may not have a strong enough muscle signal to initiate finger movement.  Taking that into consideration we have plans to explore and develop alternative ways to control the  Nu Hand that are not limited to muscle sensors. The goal of this Kickstarter project is to finish the  Nu Hand prototype that will open the door to new possibilities in the market. With your help, we hope to be able to achieve our goal on this project. Thank you for your time and attention!  We will continue to update you on our research and development progress. Social MediaWe hope to keep you updated on the progress of our research and development through various social media outlets. Rewards: Here is a quick look at the rewards. ","Drive System Design - We do not anticipate any delays in developing and designing various electronic components, however we do understand the challenge of creating a drive system that runs off a single motor. We have already been investigating novel ways to create this part. We will continue to research and develop other methods to test our prototype until we complete the drive system.Mechanical Testing - We have experience testing various materials to failure. We will be performing extensive tests to determine the upper limits and the minimum requirements to create a functional hand suitable for regular use. If there are any red flags or problems to address in terms of quality, we will rigorously examine solutions.  Our goal is to produce a quality product that is durable. We have already designed testing apparatuses to perform these mechanical tests, and we may have to develop more tests to ensure quality. If additional tests are required, we will have to develop or purchase additional testing apparatuses as well.Post Processing - We want to develop a refined prototype that is aesthetically pleasing and marketable to a wide audience. We have a process to finish the 3D printed parts that makes them ‘stronger’.  At this time, we are not promising silicon skin analogs for the prototype, but we may potentially be able to incorporate this feature as well. If we are close to integrating the silicon with the prototype, we may delay our final hand shipment to do just that. However, if a backer who pledged at the rewards level ($999 - $1999) would like their hand without the silicone, we would be more than willing to ship it without this integration.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/biomechrg/hobby-hand?ref=discovery_category_newest,biomechrg/hobby-hand,"OverviewBRG has created a 3D printed robotic hand that better mimics natural hand movement that anyone can easily learn to control. We are presenting the Hobby Hand as an open source test bench that will preview technologies borrowed from the Nu-Hand (our previous Kickstarter attempt). The Hobby Hand is an affordable kit that will aid in the further development of our 3D prosthetic hands. This platform is ideal for hobbyists, tinkerers, DIYers, and those who are interested in learning about robotics. The ‘Hobby Hand’ can also be used as an introductory educational platform for programming, micro-controllers, analog sensors, and hardware.Hobby Hand Design SummaryThe Hobby Hand contains 5 servo motors for lateral movement and a servo motor frame that houses 5 additional servo motors for flexion. A top piece mounts the hand onto the servo motor frame that guides the flexion cables to the servos. A servo motor base contains the Arduino mega + servo shield that attaches under the servo motor frame. This is the 'control' center of the Hobby Hand where all of the motors, sensors and additional peripherals are attached to the board. Each finger has a total of 4 bands that saddle the center line (symmetry in plane) to maximize the stability of each finger. The elastic bands bring the finger back to its original position after closing. A rear covering is attached to the back of the Hobby Hand frame.How is the Hobby Hand 'controlled'?The hobby hand utilizes an Arduino mega board, which is an open source micro-controller. The mega board is mated with a sensor shield that has an incredible amount of expandability and flexibility. Consumers can use custom code or code provided by BRG to perform various movements.Is that a mixer board?We have developed an analog board of potentiometers that can control flexion and lateral movement of each finger.We plan on refreshing the design of the analog controller board to include a 3D printed case and proper knobs as our campaign progresses.Is it hard to put together?The unassembledkit requires soldering and the use of basic hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers and scissors).  All kits will include a step by step instruction manual along with tutorials and other resources on our webpage to help you become proficient in no time!If that is undesirable, we also offer the Hobby Hand assembled and ready to go right out of the box.What else can the Hobby Hand do?The hobby hand comes with a mini breadboard that is attached to the servo motor frame. This allows for the addition of extra analog sensors (light, sound, muscle and others), LED's and speakers. Examples will be provided on updates!What happens if a component fails on the Hobby Hand?The great thing about the Hobby Hand is that it is completely modular. Any component can be quickly replaced or even repaired. A catalog of parts and part numbers will be included in the instructions manual for orders.The nitty gritty of the Hobby HandMaterials: The hobby hand is 3D Printed using PLA (Polylactic Acid), which is a thermoplastic that is environmental friendly (biodegrades in nature without harmful by-products). Power: The Arduino mega requires an external power adapter to drive the servo motors. A 5V 4 Amp charger is included with the complete Hobby Hand kit.Hobby Hand Scale: Is it life sized? Yes! The hand was modeled after Tim's own hand and is life sized with roughly the sameproportions.Hobby Hand Movement: 5 servo motors generate lateral motion (side-to-side finger wagging), and 5 servo motors to close each finger. Each motor can move independently. Hobby Hand Grip Strength: The hobby hand runs off a tension cable that is fixed to a pulley wheel. The stall torque of each servo motor ranges from 1.8 - 2 kg*cm (1.56 -1.74 lbs*in). Hobby Hand Lateral Strength: The hobby hand lateral movements will be generated using rigid metal rods (similar to RC airplane ailerons). The stall torque of each servo motor ranges from 1.5 - 1.8 kg*cm (1.301 - .56 lbs*in).  Hobby Hand Weight: The complete assembly weighs roughly 3 lbs (10 servos, Arduino board, Hobby Hand, base and analog controller).Hobby Hand Project TimelineSocial Media!Follow us for the latest and greatest from the Hobby Hand. We can't do it without your support!","The Hobby Hand design is complete.  The attachments of the lateral servos will come as an update during the campaign.  A digital instruction manual will be completed before the end of the campaign and will be available on our website.  Additional code snippets and tutorials will also be available as well.We do not foresee any major risks or challenges.  However, we are at the mercy of distributors in receiving all of the parts that are included with the hobby hand kits."

Meghan loves fashion, dancing, music, photography, going to movies and meeting for coffee, typically all the girlie things. Alec loves fast cars, gaming, robots, computers, sports, fishing and lounging in front of the TV eating junk, typically all the boy things. Not much in common hu? Wrong, they both love Top Gear, like millions of others world wide, young and old, boys and girls, men and women. Sunday evening there is no fight for the TV controls, probably the only time in our house when there isn't a fight for them. So whats Jeremy Clarkson got to do with what we are doing?Between us, we came up with an idea for a baseball cap with a embedded camera which can livestream and record footage from the wearers point of view (POV). So what use would a cap with these functions have and why would anybody want up an app and gaming business? So how will a baseball cap with live streaming and recordingfunctions help us? Well, living in Africa, we have all sorts of local fashions which are not seen in other parts of the world, plus we see a lot of international fashion as tourists flock to Africa to go on safari and see our wildlife and scenery. Meghan is combining these fashions to design unique multi cultural fashions which will be marketed and sold on her online business. Alec is setting up a gaming business using live footage from some of the African adventures and adrenaline activities, such as bungie jumping, game fishing, mountain biking, bush racing and capturing real time safari which can then be developed into online, live eco-hunting games. Imagine being on safari, filming what you are seeing and the footage being live streamed to your friends PS4 or Xbox and they can watch a live safari. Or, if they want some action they can play a live reality game and hunt the animals, have the thrills of a real live hunt, but with no harm to any animals. So whilst you are on safari, your mates are there with you, but in the comfort of their homes. This was our original idea for the use of a Baseball Cap with the camera and functions. Then the news of Jeremy Clarkson broke and we, like millions were devastated that we may not be able to watch our favorite program and presenter again. What could we do the help?So we said to ourselves ""What if everybody wore cameras so that everything could be recorded and is recorded and from all angles?"" Anybody wearing one of our caps could use it to film everyday events which they could then use the footage for their own YouTube channels, online business or gaming business like the ones which Meghan and Alec are both setting up. Meghan suggested ""What If Jeremy was wearing one of our smart baseball caps with the embedded camera and sound, then he could have streamed the footage to his smart phone and uploaded the footage to social media?"". If Jeremyhad beenwearing one of our caps, he could have live streamed what actuallyhappened and his producer Oisin Tymon could have done the same. Capturing the footage could have beenviewedby millions andprobably been used to make the best episode of Top Gear ever. It would have showed some of the behindscenes and realtime reality whilst it was happening. It would also have recored the facts of what actually happened. Plus we could have watched James May's antics whilst under the influence and his reaction to the ""dust up"".Enter Meghan and Alec's dad, Nick. Nick is an entrepreneur and especially schooled in filing patents for proprietary ideas. Nick loved the idea and decided to help his young entrepreneurial kids to bring the Smart Cap to reality. Alec, who is a ski speed freak and with his YouTube channel, named ""SnowStig"" suggested branding it ""Stoked Cap"". Meghan is an avid snowboarder and said that shewantedto wear a Smart Cap and film the footage of hergetting ""stoked"" on the slopes whilst boarding off piste in a couloir with a meter of fresh powder or riding the half pipe.So ""Stocked Wearables"" became the name.Nick soon became entrigued with thepossibilities of the smart cap, not just with the uses for gaming, fashion or helping Jeremy Clarkson but the possibilities of helping young kids being abused or kidnapped, thugs could be filmed mugging old people by a passerby wearing a cap, cyclists being knocked over in the city by hit and run drivers. What about all the moments at school sports where the parents can not get time off work to go watch their kids and feel guilty for not being there? The footage of how your kids are playing, how they did, all the hours of disappointment and guilt of not being able to watch your kids playing because you could get time of work. You can now watch them live from your smart phones whilst at work or watch the recorded footage once you get home.After making a few phone calls with some friend in China, Nick arranged to fly over with Alec for a few days to develop the technology and apps, negotiate the development costs, timing, prototypes and minimum production runs.The more the idea developed the more Nick became convinced the world might just be a better place all if we lived by the motto ""See something, Say something, Show something"" and become involved discreetly by knowing that your streaming videos might just make a difference.Je Suis says it all. As Francoise Hollande, President of Francesaid""We must all stand united, there is power in ourtogetherness."" We will not be robbed of our freedom by extremists, radicals and kidnappers.The ""Stoked cap"" has an embedded video/stills and camera for sound that will record and store but will also live stream to Smart phones, iPads and tablets which can then be uploaded to social media and YouTube. We can envision streaming footage that is captured by our Smart Caps to News feeds on the web and on live TV and eventually to support a proprietary TV channel that puts fantastic reality footage, funny footage, outrageous footage in the public domain for all to view. It can put good guys, bad guys on notice that their actions will be captured and broadcast in perpetuity. Its all about showing events as they are, making the world a better and safer place.If you have a favourite campaign or cause and enough support for a short production run, please just be in touch and we will work with you.What is this campaign about?We are in an era of capture and share. We capture beautiful sunsets, first days of school, a fish being caught, a goal being scored, one million people protesting peacefully. Unfortunately we also capture terrible scenes like a misguided soul with a gun, running amok, or even a child being taken, a daughter being abducted. We want the bad guys to think twice that perhaps their picture is being recorded and simultaneously being posted to a dad's smartphone, to Instagram, Facebook or YouTube. If our Stoked Cap is a deterrent we're happy.What is the Stoked smart cap?The Stoked Cap (or any head ware we choose) is a normal cap that has a camera discreetly embedded.You may also upload to your computer using either wifi or the micro USB cable supplied.A specially designed app for both iOS and Android allows for the smart device to view and record the video stream. The device is capable of capturing high definition video and stills photos, and will record and store them on either it's internal memory, or stream to your smart phone/device, where it may also be stored.The device can then upload the captured video onto the web immediately using existing platforms and also our own live streaming app""Stokedwearables"".Down load it now, it's free.What you get :","There are no risks, the product is fully developed and working. The challenges are getting enough orders to do a full production run."

They're fellow graduates and other students still completing the program. They've mostly never been paid to make movies, but they have an incredible passion and drive to make movies. We want to honor that. Sound is probably the most important part of making a successful film. If your sound is top notch, everything else feels natural. We've found a professionally working Dog. As they're a professional, though, they must be paid, prep trainer, shoot day, transportation things are expensive.  . We want our film  the best it possibly can and the'll deliver on that. While we've found a great camera to shoot the project with, we're still a little short on some of the other equipment, with our biggest need being in the lighting department. We no longer have the luxury of using whatever PSU has available. We're aiming to buy a small lighting kit and a few LED's to help us through the shoot. There are a few locations that will require us to pay a small fee for their use and this money will be used to ensure we're able to pay those fees and shoot the film as we're imagining it.

For some, that is sailing. For others, it is drowning. Those wishing not to sink may await a raft of faith, or they may become raft-makers themselves. Whatever their method, the sea is the same: In life we wish for permanence, but only in death do we receive it.In today's age, science and technology are the raft-maker's tools, and life-extension her expedition. Though death still hovers over all of us, we are distancing ourselves from it more and more. At present we have life-saving drugs, artificial limbs and organs, life support systems for the critically wounded- things which prolong the lives of those who'd otherwise be dead. Assuming life-extension will at some point reach the height its proponents wish of it, we'll eventually have the option to tweak our biology via cell restructuring. Following that, we may even be presented with the choice to replace our biology in total with a more durable system, an event termed ""Transhumanism."" Either way, there will be a metamorphosis.The promise of such transformation may excite the drowning man who hopes to see- not merely dream up- a shore, yet it fails to address the tsunami of existential crises which will undoubtedly ripple through him. Is death a channel to or a dam against hell?The above question brings me at last to the purpose of this campaign: the realization of a short film called Inquietus. Three years ago, while studying in a library, my mind was suddenly hit with images of alien beings marching over a barren world, beneath a dark cosmos, from birth to death. No doubt stress-induced, the images were a manifestation of the anxiety I felt at the time regarding my own fleeting existence. There I was on a sunny summer afternoon, tucked into a cubicle full of information on subjects I had no passion for. As I endeavored to learn for the sake of passing exams, I wondered if I might be wasting my prime years. That consideration then led me to wonder if I may ever get those years back so as to live them bravely rather than safely. But what is life if not a time limit? Would the gift of eternal youth really bring with it the happiness I so often thirsted for at that time, or would it instead plunge me into a whole new sea of problems?I've been an artist my whole life. In childhood I sometimes wrote stories, mostly drew pictures, but always loved movies. When I became an adult, film's allure as a medium for expression, not just spectacle, grew within me. The sketchpad, which had been my world until then, became a satellite to the world of motion pictures whereupon I'd crash landed. Random concept art evolved into characters, then scenes, then storyboards of imaginary films. Jot-downs became brainstorms became outlines became short scripts. No matter the origin of my creative thoughts, they were by then, as they are still now, almost always translated in terms of how they might be applied to the art of visual story-telling. Whatever the seed of Inquietus, the stem of a movie has already sprouted, and I'm determined to see it blossom.Using computer animation, Inquietus will tell the story of a parade of creatures destined for oblivion. One by one the creatures hatch into life, grow up, breed, then vanish into the chasm. It's a cycle, presumably unalterable- or so it appears until one especially prescient individual decides to jam the wheel. Employing technology s/he invented during the death march, the film's protagonist manages to avoid the void. A second parade begins, this time for a party of one. The wheel's spin reverses as the protagonist marches forward into the past. I've already storyboarded, in the form of nearly 600 .5"" x 1"" panels, the entire film. Moreover, I've already compiled the first third of those storyboards into an animatic (rough cut) representing the film's first act. Completing the animatic is all that remains in the preproduction phase. The next step will be to use the animatic as a reference for beginning the production phase- actually animating the film in 3D. My hope is that, by now, many of you reading this feel inspired to help get the film to that next level.We are all stranded on the same sea. Some of us sail within strong hulls by way of steady winds. Others barely keep afloat upon thrashing waves. Yet none of us can evade the precipitation. Empowered or enslaved, pure or depraved, your skin will be pruned, your bones eroded, and your mind washed away by the same tide that washed you up. Whether with hands together in prayer, or hands apart in labor, our drive against the tide of time echoes from the same fear. Inquietus is my attempt at addressing that fear. But it's even more than that. It's a parable for mankind's obsession with having total control. It's about our desire that existence be the opposite of what it really is.","I'm going to make Inquietus entirely by myself. The film may be short, but it's highly ambitious, or so I like to think. Furthermore, the visuals will be very detailed. Thus the scope of the project, coupled with the fact that this will be my first serious attempt at creating a fictional movie, screams of an enormous undertaking.And I believe I will prevail. To merit that claim, I invite you to watch the video I've attached to this project, if you haven't done so already. If nothing else, the video is a portfolio of drawings, animation and editing, all of which I did entirely myself. Any free time I had from school when I attended was largely spent working on the contents of the attached video. The same holds true for the days off I've had from my job since then, as well as for lunch breaks, bus rides, Friday nights and weekends. In short, all other areas of my life have been sidelined to reserve as much time and calories as could be put into this presentation.All of the above is to say I believe I've already proven my ability to take on an ambitious task unaided, and succeed with it. To further illustrate, take the bit of 3D animation exhibited at the end of my video. The sword fighter featured therein represents the first low-poly model I'd ever created and the first 3D animation I'd ever done. Regarding sculpture of the model, I managed that by finding a video recording someone had made of themselves constructing a low-poly model. By pausing the two-hour video every few seconds, then mimicking the observed action with my own copy of the software, I learned how to sculpt a model within a day's time. Regarding the animation, I approached that challenge on my own like an enraged gorilla. In the end, though the model and animation aren't exactly polished, all things considered I think the piece turned out well.There's no denying that what I'm aiming to do with Inquietus is of a larger scale than anything I've attempted before. But this isn't a matter of scale so much as it a matter of passion and determination. When it comes to making movies, I'm a beginner. And like all beginners seeking support, passion and determination are my resume. I ask that you take a chance with me based on those qualities, so that I may begin building a body of work from them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/779628401/inquietus-a-short-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,779628401/inquietus-a-short-film,"As a general rule, there are three stages to making a movie: Pre-production, Production, and Post-production. During the pre-production stage, a great deal of planning takes place so as to ensure the next stage (production) runs as smoothly as possible. Among the many elements that are planned for is the look of the movie, which can be hinted at through the use ofstoryboards and animatics. A storyboard is a still image representing one shot of a movie scene, and is often hand-drawn like a cartoon (example). An animatic is several storyboards edited together into a video so as to give an idea of how the final movie should be filmed/animated during production. Here is an animatic I made for Act I (the beginning) ofINQUIETUS- the short film I hope to create using the funding generated by this kickstarter project:The animatic above was created using .5"" x 1"" storyboards that I drew over the course of several months. Additionally, it was made by also using some larger scale conceptual art that I drew during that same period. The following video gives a glimpse of some of those storyboards and conceptual drawings, as well as explains what the film is about:I've already storyboarded the entire film to completion. The only task that remains in the pre-production stage of this project is to combine the storyboards for Acts II(the middle) and III(the end) with the animatic for Act I. The outcome will be an animatic representing the whole movie, and thus a reference for how the film should be animated during production. The movie will be animated using computer graphics. This next video is of a 3d sculpture I built and animated in preparation for this project. This is only for the purpose of allowing you, the viewer, to critique my skill level as a 3d modeler/animator and has nothing to do with Inquietus in terms of content. Like the animatic, the following example is rough, and shouldn't be mistaken for how the finished film will look:Although it features strange beings and an alien world, Inquietus is actually about us- the human race. It's about our fear of death and the measures we take to postpone our end for as long as possible. Diet, exercise, drugs, artificial limbs and organs- these are some of the methods we use to extend our lives for just a little bit more. Yet such methods pale by comparison with what might be on the horizon.A movement is underway to reverse aging and achieve immortality. It's not rooted in pseudoscience, but rather is being spearheaded by highly intelligent people. The implications of this pursuit are staggering. If life-extension ever reaches the height its proponents wish of it, we may have the option to change our biology via cell restructuring. Following that, we may even be presented with the choice to replace our biology in total with a more durable system (an event termed ""Transhumanism"").The promise of such transformation may seem exciting, but it fails to address the tsunami of existential crises which will undoubtedly ripple through the newly-immortalized: Is death a channel to or a dam against hell?I've been an artist my whole life ( http://www.mattjturner.com ). I've also been troubled by the concept of death for as long as I can remember. This project is the culmination of those two aspects of my character. Inquietusis my attempt at conveying the reservations I have regarding our effort to inoculate ourselves against the forces of nature. ","I'm going to make Inquietus entirely by myself.

I am focusing on healthy food production using less water, no environmentally hazardous chemicals, and being able to grow more food on a smaller portion of land. Aquaponics is a simple process of using water and fish to grow plants.  -The Fish excrete ammonia-Bacteria in the water processes ammonia into Nitrites-Separate Bacteria than covert the Nitrites to Nitrates-Plants absorb Nitrates and their root system helps filter the waterThere is a bit more to it in a commercial system, but that is a simple breakdown.I started experimenting with Aquaponics last year. I have my own small setup where I grow a coupletomatoplants and some strawberries.  I use a flood and drain system and a vertical grow tower. Both are doing very well. Goldfish are my workers. I have not experimented with any other types of fish for which you farm. The main goal that I keep reading about, when starting an operation like this, is an emphasis on Vegetable production. Some species of fish take 2-3 years before they can be farmedsustainability.I plan on starting small with about 1 acre of land. On this 1 acre using vertical grow techniques and rafts I can grow a surprisingly high volume of fruits and vegetables. I want to set the system up so harvest are timed and I am picking every month and than as I gain more experience, every week I will have a batch of fresh veggie's. Starting at the local Farmers Markets and than hopefully moving up to supplying restaurants or even Elementary and High Schools with fresh produce weekly.    The money I am trying to raise is for part of the land. I am have my own savings that I want to spend on theinfrastructureand seeds. The price of land continues to go upand I am trying to make sure I remain close to a City, within at least 50 miles.I am looking to this as being motivation for individuals to start farming. During this build I plan on recording and making a video series on YouTube or build a website where I create a blog or forum. I want it to be in-depth and show the ins and outs of starting a Commercial Aquaponics Farm. I feel it necessary to motivate at least some younger individuals to go into Agriculture so we can sustain a growing population. This practice of farming can continue through the droughts (using %90 less water than growing in soil) and produce healthy nutrient rich food in a smaller space without having to add chemicals to the water like Hydroponics.","This project has a few hurdles. The biggest one I have ran into is acquiring land. In the area I plan on starting, land is not cheap. I only want to start with 1 acre but that is still rather expensive. I plan on using any money I get for this project on the Land. I have my own money I wanted to invest for most of the infrastructure, and acquiring a smaller loan is easier than a loan for a majority of the project.I am educated in the subject and other than getting the materials there are a lot of hours I will have to put in the initial set-up.

Aquaponics is a simple process of using water and fish to grow plants.  I started experimenting with Aquaponics last year. I have my own small setup where I grow a couple tomato plants and some strawberries. I use a flood and drain system and a vertical grow tower. Both are doing very well. Goldfish are my workers. I have not experimented with any other types of fish for which you farm. The main goal that I keep reading about, when starting an operation like this, is an emphasis on Vegetable production. Some species of fish take 2-3 years before they can be farmed sustainability. I plan on starting small with about 1 acre of land. On this 1 acre using vertical grow techniques and rafts I can grow a surprisingly high volume of fruits and vegetables. I want to set the system up so harvest are timed and I am picking every month and than as I gain more experience, every week I will have a batch of fresh veggie's. Starting at the local Farmers Markets and than hopefully moving up to supplying restaurants or even Elementary and High Schools with fresh produce weekly. The money I am trying to raise is for part of the land. I am have my own savings that I want to spend on the infrastructure and seeds. The price of land continues to go up and I am trying to make sure I remain close to a City, within at least 50 miles.","This project has a few hurdles. The biggest one I have ran into is acquiring land. In the area I plan on starting, land is not cheap. I only want to start with 1 acre but that is still rather expensive. I plan on using any money I get for this project on the Land. I have my own money I wanted to invest for most of the infrastructure, and acquiring a smaller loan is easier than a loan for a majority of the project.I am educated in the subject and other than getting the materials there are a lot of hours I will have to put in the initial set-up. I have some concerns about the fish and keeping them alive while they adjust to the environment but that's normal for any fish tank."

It was her support an encourage that pushed me through the program and inspired me to finish my collection for publication. The day she passed a close friend of mine who is now a freelance photographer posted a picture of the sun rising above the clouds. It was then that God placed on my heart to name my book The Rise above the Clouds. I believe He wanted to remind me that I still had to go on and live my life and that this is what my mom wanted me to do. She was so excited that I was completing graduate school and finishing up my poetry collection. I know that she is looking down from above the clouds! I am dedicating this book to her....my hero.

this way it can be subtitled in several languages ​​as in the example, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and English, however if you get to the right voices dubbing would be in Spanish exclusively with some

15, and TVpaint, as shown in the example, likewise at the beginning and end the sponsors would be placed with a sufficient time to be noticed and remain as evidence of your sponsorship.The resources granted would be used to complement the tools of the work, as well as the quality of the animation, the quality of the audio and composition, as well as the most personalized subtitling for each character, along with voice dubbing, unpublished scenes that would not be for the movie but for ""digital rewards"" deliverables in progress the animation by means of download, as well as the

You've wondered what goes on beneath the waves and dreamed of knowing. Well I'd like to make those dreams a reality by finally bringing mankind underwater in a new, safe, clean way! Imagine a luxury resort and waterpark with views unlike anything you've seen before. Wake up in your hotel room to see a whale pass by your window! Drift down a lazy river with dolphins swimming along side you while your having the time of your life in the most unique place on Earth. Its finally possible! This is the very first stage of the project. This project will consist of 3 stages. The funds raised by this stage will go towards team building and concept development. If the first stage is successful we will then move on to stage 2 which will focus on concept testing, construction preparation, and land development. If both of the first stages are successful we will then move on to the third and final stage which will be the actual complex construction! There will be a new Kickstarter campaign started for every stage of this project. You can help make this happen today with just a small contribution, or by sharing our story with your friends and helping us get the word out there!

Being able to see every nook and cranny of your own coral reef in amazing detail with a fish-eye-view. My vision of the Aqua-View Robotic Eye would allow it. This robot would be a small waterproof sphere about 2 inches around that has a tiny HD camera similar to the one in your smart phone, the camera would be located in the center, and two fans for easy movement located on the top and sides of the sphere. The fans would be housed safely inside of the Aqua-View and protected by a fine wire mesh to insure the safety of your aquatic inhabitants. The device would connect to your smartphone wirelessly via wi-fi or bluetooth allowing you to control the robots every move all while enjoying the unique underwater view. Take photos or videos right from the app and have them save directly to your phone. Connect your phone to your TV for an even more enjoyable view for the whole family. Or take the Aqua-View to your local pond or pool to get some incredible shots. Whatever you decide to view with our little robot will look great. This project is designed to fund the creation of a prototype. If you think this is a product that needs to be developed then please make a pledge or help spread the word by sharing our project to your friends! If this project is successfully funded then we will be able to finish the prototype design and get started on the final kickstarter project giving you access to receive your very own Aqua-View, but that cant happen without you!

As a matter of fact, it is the only vegetarian place in the county as well. Ournew landlord told us if we can make it on Beach St., then we can make it anywhere Toot toot. We became a destination, on a strip that does not have foot traffic. We also thrived on low cost advertising, like word of mouth and facebook, enabling to reinvest in our business more. In the same spirit as the farmers market, where we began with three children, we continue to grow as a family and as entrepreneurs. Now with five children to feed, it is time for store numbertwo folks!Why on earth would we take on such a risky and challenging feat? We honestly love the excitement.

You then realize that the hardest choice of your life that day is do you get a Vegan Value Meal with BBQ seitan or do you order the house made Veggie Burger? One thing you know for sure is that the kale salad dressing is what got you turned out from being a kale virgin in the first place. You decide to grab a Rootsman Skank juice made to order, and the ginger being juiced clears your sinuses up immediately.If the sound of this scene makes you happy, then you would love Kale Cafe. We are about family, friends, and sharing our love for veganism and our Jamaican heritage with our customers. We want to make Kale Cafe available for more people, because when non-vegans taste our food, it excites them about eating plant based foods. Firstly, we have had several delays and are so near the finish line. We have to pay some contractors to get our final permits and certificate of occupancy.  Additionally, we need help to make sure we have the equipment we need to be efficient as we grow our business. We want to have create your own salads, and we desperately need the inventory to switch to all eco- friendly packaging and begin to brand ourselves. Finally, we want to stock both the stores with bulk nuts, beans, etc.bottles for packaging our salad dressing. We learned many lessons along the way and have invested over 80k of our own monies and are just tapped out and do not want to drag this out any longer, because it could jeopardize our business if we do not open the store ASAP. ","We have already beaten the odds and proven to be entrepreneurs that are too legit to quit, in the words of MC Hammer.  Unstoppable if you will, we see something we want and we go after it. We fall down and get back up and frolic ahead.   Nearly 4 years after opening our first store, we are back, wiser and better and finally getting systems in place that we need to dominate the vegan scene nationally.  We have already faced the challenges of crooked contractors, bad accountant advice, expanding too soon, hurricanes, burglary, ""affordable broken equipment""! Over staffing and under staffing, lack of inventory, too much inventory. . .you name it we tackled it, and all with grace and style, while expanding our family to 8!  We still manage to fail our way forward and make progress and grow as a company and as a family.  We even aired our mistakes on national TV, when MSNBC came to film us for the program Your Business (click the videos to see it).  The lessons we have learned have been all blessings in some way or another and have furthermore given us the fortitude and resilience that we have to keep going after our dream of building a company that flourishes and allows other cool people to duplicate Kale Café and serve their communities delicious vegan food."

We have completed the updates to pass that obstacle as well as pass for our food license. Our menu will include mouth watering 1/3 specialty burgers, family style meals, a snack menu and drink menu for the teen hangout crowd.Our building has not always been loved by all its owners.

I formed a team of 3 people can develop the project ""Dungeon Master"" to a new level: ""Rebirth""!Although primarily be based almost true to the original version for the Atari ST / Amiga, we plan to add new features:- Quest- Periodical events- Your own home in a common area to meet other players (crossplatform)- New levels called ""rebirth"" (initially are planned 30lv)- New system of higher levels of the characters.- The Tavern, ""The Inn"", a safe place to heal and rest.- The shops, in the game, for upgrades, spells, items and various.and many other features that will enrich this magnificent game.","""Dungeon Master"" has no copyright, and today there are many versions, made bad or ruining the initial spirit of the game.Our team consists of professionals who have decided to try to make something creative, like a video game, because in addition to programmers, graphic designers and sellers, we are also gamers.Our preparation is already established in the business world by far 90s.I see no problems in the creation of games, both in developing the server side for the new online features, which in the development of mobile devices (iOS / Android / Microsoft).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/armandoolivieri/hoootpocket?ref=discovery_category_newest,armandoolivieri/hoootpocket,"I have always worked in the IT industrial sector, but my passion has always been to make video games. I have been programming since 1985 and now I would like to start taking my first steps in the video game industry, creating games that can entertain and at the same time be a challenge against the machine, as it was in the golden age of coin-op ('80 -'90).hoootPocket is a game idea between the puzzle game and the action game: you choose the champion, and you fight against the opponent, through the combinations of monsters on the game grid.The game can be played in single player and online multiplayer on Android and iOS mobile devices.At the beginning there will be only one sample available; other champions will be unlockable at the end of the stages, defeating the final boss (who then becomes a selectable champion). In single player mode you can play 5 stages that include 20 difficulty levels (the nineteenth level will fight against yourself (mirror level) and the twentieth level (final level) with the Boss who if defeated will become a champion available)Each sample has four characteristics: experience, HP, Armor, speed. The experience is acquired during the game and will change the hp / armor / speed parameters proportionally. HP is the life available for combat, Armor is the level of defense and speed is the speed of action that affects the main attack / defense bar.Game mode:The game focuses on the skill of playing and the experience it acquires during challenges.The battlefield is displayed at the top of the screen: hp and armor of the two champions who compete are displayed above them (red = hp, green = armor).The action bar is displayed just below the battlefield:Action Bar: depending on the stage and the level, the action bar is exhausted over time if no valid combinations are made.The game is free pattern! It will be possible to move monsters freely within the game grid: when two or more monsters of the same color are contiguous (horizontal / vertical, in line or not in line, for example to form an ""L"") it will be possible to decide to launch the attack, simply by touching the screen and selecting all the monsters that are part of the attack; when you release your finger the attack will be launched and the monsters will be destroyed, leaving room for new monsters. Whenever two or more monsters are positioned continuously, the action bar will load (which will download over time), so the more skilled and quick you are, the more powerful the attack (based on the charge of the action bar). Monsters don't attack automatically, but the player will decide the maximum combo to use (up to a maximum of 5 monsters of the same color).Each monster, based on color, has 3 well-defined characteristics that will affect attack, defense and speed.Below the action bar is the opponent's combo bar which will show the incoming attack combo.Under the opponent's combo bar, the game grid is displayed.Attack / Defense: When you decide to attack, you can also decide to defend yourself: in this case instead of attacking, HP and Armor will regenerate.The game will use the ""star coin"" as virtual currency, which can be purchased on the Google and Apple stores which will allow you to make purchases in the game shop.hoootPocket uses three basic objects: soul gem, first aid and hammer:The gems of the soul allow you to start the game, the first aid to restore life at the end of the match (in case of victory) and the hammer to repair the armor (in case of victory). If you exit the game or are defeated, first aid and armor automatically regenerate.A soul gem will cost 10 ""star coins"", 1 first aid pack and armor pack will cost 5 ""star coins"".Once the soul gems are finished, you can buy them from the internal shop or wait for them to recharge: 1 per hour for a maximum of 5 per day; as an alternative the game also features a ""wheel of fortune"" which for the cost of only one ""star coin"" offers the possibility of winning soul gems, ""star coins"", first aid kit and armor kit.hoootPocket has a consecutive daily reward system over a week: the more consecutive days you play, the more rewards will be greater. The rewards will be ""star coins"", soul gems, first aid and hammers.At the first start of the game you will have 10 ""star coins"", 5 soul gems, 5 first aid kits and 5 armor kits.The game also records personal and world records, and all achievements obtained during the game. All general usage statistics will also be available (example: game time).The multiplayer mode will be managed by dedicated servers: it will be possible to register your username. The dedicated hoootPocket holder allows you to: manage friends, view statistics, achievements and interact with the community.To create hoootPocket I need to involve graphic designers and programmers in the project, which I have already selected.I attach the photoshop concept of the game screen, Champion selection and level selection.","hoootPocket is a mobile game and fears only two conditions: not having funds to be able to make and advertise it; that you may not like. In my opinion it is a carefree and addictive game but above all original in a basin saturated with similar products and made for the sole purpose of selling advertising. My philosophy is ""play and enjoy""."

You can do this by first learning from many youtube videos.Then, Later you realize, it is the most tedious and time consuming DYI.I know, I have done it. And also making really ugly 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generation prototype made me realize that the final ready to produce EGO Cell will save a lot of people from making mistakes I made. The first goal of the project was to make a solar blind to feed grid-tie inverter to cut my electric bills. Many people put a solar panel now. But did you know many electric companies require you to install separate meter so they can buy it at whole sale price and sell you back at higher rate? Which means having generating 100WH of energy inside your house will save about same amount of moneyas600WH outside. As my brain working thanks to a lot of energy drinks, The problems in PV blind came up. Solar Cell (PV Cell) is very fragile, and what is one is broken? Sure, you can replace one cell, but it will be much easier replacing one whole panel and this might be cheaper too.So, the blind can fold down to pretty small volume that can easily be carried around, can we use it as portable unit?Yes, but you might break it.Then I saw my son playing with LEGO(R) Blocks. Can I make one like a Lego blocks so I can make anything, like Car Shade to charge the car while parked at the airport parking lot. Take it to camping, so I can charge my phone and computer, or even run a small fridge. Easy to replace broken if it ever breaks, and make any configuration I want (1.5V, 5V, 9V, etc) Sturdy, so It will withstand some stress.So I started design with simplicity in my mind, but that did not come out good. Then made changes, also not quite good. Another change, then I reached my skill limit and still not quite alright. I have broken a lot, I mean a lot, of PV cells on the way, then came up with some what simple but much better design. So, now I need some support, to make production ready samples and get EGO Cell going to save our ECO system from more nuclear power plants, landscape ruining wind generators, and trashed solar panels that fills our land fills. And best of all, EGO Cell is reusable, re-configurable, and can easily replace.","The risk of creating a casing for the PV cell is very high. The specification for ultimate goal is    - easy connection for either series parallel   - minimize weight   - minimize size.   - can accommodate decent amount of power.With set specification, the work has to be done to best fit.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/72275259/fresh-indoor-air-cafe-happy-tykes?ref=discovery_category_newest,72275259/fresh-indoor-air-cafe-happy-tykes,"What we want to create: We want to create a café where adults and kids can enjoy together.What we will be serving: For adult, we will be serving coffee, tea, and light pastry, and fresh squeezed juice. For kids and toddlers and infants, we will be serving light pastry, fresh squeezed juice, and puree of steamed vegetables in a tube pack.For all family, we will be serving ourhealthy combo meals without containingGMO.The interior :Café Happy Tykes will be consists of a Café Area, Playgrounds, andA room for piano lesson. Café Area: Counter, Serving Area, and Lounge with Booths (Wi-Fi is available)Playground:Safe and clean playground for Infants, Toddlers, and Big Kids.Care Area:   2 Family Restrooms with kid’s toilets and sink, and Diaper Change Station.Atmosphere :Café Happy Tykes will have two different kinds of atmosphere: One for Café, and one for playgrounds. Playground noise will be reduced in café area with glass panels dividing two areas. Ultimately we want to create an indoor facility with fresh air of outside.What's The differences? (1) Fresh AirCafé Happy Tykes will be different than any pre-existing baby café. We want fresh air. We want to install a Total Air Conditioning System- Filter, Cool or Heat, Humidity, and Sanitize. This System will also reduce cooling cost since air is already cooled by evaporative cooler. We came up with this system to minimize the cost and provide children with highest quality air they can breathe while being active. Other method is to have a multiple commercial air purifier, Humidifier, Dehumidifier, and fan to vent the air which will introduce allergens, and dust inside. Along with above configuration, carefully and strategically located pressure relieve vent is required to have better circulate the air, and to make evaporate cooler work better. (2) A Unique Family Café in Extreme WeatherHappy Tykes is a proper place for parents who have babies especially in place with an extreme weather like Tucson, Arizona. In fact, Tucson has not many places where parents with babies can go out, so we have designed such an indoor space to give them a joyful moment.They just can simply spend their time having fun in Café Happy Tykes. (3) Caring the CommunityWe always think how we can care of kids in lower income family as well. Therefore, we will provide some regular events such as Happy Tykes Day, 2nd Friday of each month, when entry fee will be free for everyone and sampling of organic food from local restaurants. Moreover, entry fee will be inexpensive for all family's frequent use.Also, portion of the profit will be allocated for programs like Lunch box for kids and some tutoring programs.   The stretched goal is to install air quality monitor in play area and care area to monitor the air quality and try to make better air for the children to breathe.So what is Café Happy Tykes?Café Happy Tykes’ main goal is to make our children more active and healthy as well as their parents by giving them the best quality air to breathe while psychologically tranquilized.Moreover, all family can have muchfun and enjoy our healthy meals.",The challenge of this project is to get the permit from the city as this is new design of the cooling system.

Do you see artificial flavors, colors, and maybe even something called propyl gallate (a potentially cancer causing preservative)? What about ""salt""- refined, mineraldeficient, additive-filled salt? And ""milk"" or ""butter"", aka animal products?Do you see a plastic coating inside the bag (which leaks into your popcorn while being microwaved)? Yeah, we thought so!Guess what? We at Mr. Bates Popcorn have worked hard to bring you microwave popcorn that doesn't include anyof the above in our boxes!Have a look at what's in the leading microwave popcorn brands bag vs ours:Here at Mr. Bates Popcorn, we only use quality ingredients that you can feel good about putting into your body. We are plant based, non-gmo, all-natural, dairy-free, meat-free, and soy-free! Music to yours ears, right?We devoured microwave popcorn for years and years before finally looking at the ingredients and realizing that we didn't want that nasty stuff in our bodies ever again. Since there's really nothing like a steaming bag of tasty popcorn, we set out to make something better- and with flavors that are more fun and delicious than what you're used to!Who's ready to say goodbye to chemical-filled ""buttered"" popcorn and replace it with a more delicious, vegan, healthy alternative? So are we!Not only is a bag of our popcorn less than half the calories of all those ""Movie Theater Butter"" microwave popcorn selections (flavor seasonings are all 0 calories!), but we're way more delicious.We came up with 3 unique and mouth-watering flavors that could satisfy anyone:    Himalayan Pink Salt    Classic ""Ranch""      Cheddar ""Cheese""HIMALAYAN PINK SALTIngredients: Himalayan Pink Salt.Made in The Himalaya'sCHEDDAR ""CHEESE""Ingredients: Almonds, Garlic, Inactive Yeast, Himalayan Pink Salt, White Pepper.Made in CaliforniaCLASSIC ""RANCH""Ingredients: Tapioca Maltodextrin, Organic Coconut Oil, Rice Syrup, Rice Fiber, Organic Guar Gum, Salt, Organic Pea Protein, Organic Garlic Powder, Rice Starch, Organic Dill Weed, Lactic Acid, Citrus Fiber, Organic Parsley, Organic Black Pepper, Calcium Lactate, Organic Brown Rice Protein, Organic Chives, Citric Acid, Rice Flour, Sunflower Lecithin.Made in North CarolinaMost of the microwave popcorn on the shelves that claim to be natural and healthy still have terrible oils like Palm Oil- which is not only awful for us, but it's the cause of massive deforestation and the demise of endangered animals in Indonesia and other countries (and about 50% of US goods are using it!). Instead, we use unrefined, cold-pressed, high oleic Sunflower Oil from a family farm in Georgia.You're probably thinking ""what the heck is high oleic and why should I care?"". High oleic sunflower oil is the good kind of sunflower oil because of its healthy fats. There are three kinds of sunflower oil: high oleic, mid oleic and linoleic. You usually find linoleic sunflower oil on the grocery store shelf today and it should be avoided because it'svery heavy in polyunsaturated fat. High oleic sunflower oil is high in monounsaturated fats (just like olive oil), so it's definitely the way to go and is even paleo and keto friendly! It also naturally has a delicious, buttery taste. Perfect for popcorn!Although our popcorn isn't just for people who don't eat animal products and/or can't consume dairy, we wanted to cater to as many people as possible. Plus, consuming vegan products (especially ones that are soy-free and all-natural) is always a good decision in our book as it's great for our bodies and our planet! We're passionate about supporting animals and the beautiful earth we all live on. Hence, vegan snacks!Each box contains:2 bags of popcorn2 oil packets2 seasoning packetsAnother thing you should know is that most microwave popcorn brands use bags that include a foil susceptor and plastic coating- Yuck!Thefoil susceptor is used to heat up the oil quickly and pop as many kernels as possible. However, that also helps the plastic coating melt and guess where it goes? Into your popcorn! Our bag is recyclable and doesn't include the foil susceptor or plastic coating.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikekrum90/written-images-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,mikekrum90/written-images-0,"Written Images No contribution is too small for this fundraiser to help support Chicago filmmaker Mike Krumlauf in his journey of his second feature length project! The goal of this film is too bring an honest, raw, and original experience to the viewer that focuses on the human condition in our early years.Synopsis: Steven, an emotional introvert has recently moved to Chicago from London to further his education. Undecided at what his major should be, a class project helps him discover his vocation in life and make the friends he was always yearning for. Nick, a young photographer suffering addiction in multiple forms, has his morals put to the test when he meets Steven. Together they begin A journey of self discovery, love and redemption in the backdrop of modern Midwestern America.What Makes This Film Unique?In the 1980s, Chicago Filmmaker John Hughes brought humanity and honesty to coming of age/adult films and put Chicago, IL on the map as one of the key Midwestern locations in American Cinema. Since John's absence and (in 2009) untimely passing, American cinema has yet to touch upon the honesty & heart John brought to Chicago with his characters' stories. Written Images plans to deliver an honest, heartfelt story of finding yourself, falling in love, and growing up in the likes of Mr. Hughes. Visually, the film is being shot on Mini DV, HDV, & RAW. The film is utilizing the different formats to convey the disarray both character's lives are in. Using these formats will also help utilize post production hard drive space and make the most cost effective workflow possible. Also, because the cameras (like other cheaper digital formats) are so small, we can shoot some of the scenes with a very small setup, without the need of a bigger crew, which requires more space, time, and money.About The Cast & Crew:CrewMike Krumlauf - Writer/Director/Cinematographer/Editor/Co-ProducerMike was born December 14th, 1990 in Maywood, Illinois. He grew up in Naperville, Illinois the majority of his life, spending a year & a half in Telluride, Colorado from late 2001-2003. Mike's passion with film began when his father gave him a video camera as a Christmas gift in 1999. In 2003, Mike was introduced to low budget DV Filmmaking and the Sony DSR-PD150 camera. He began teaching himself digital cinematography and editing, while constantly experimenting.

Arin insisted that Mike put his video artwork on A new (at the time) website YouTube. In doing so, Mike was one of the first to use the website as a DIY distribution tool for video art, which gained him a little notoriety in the online film-making community.

The goal of this film is too bring an honest, raw, and original experience to the viewer that focuses on the human condition in our early years.Synopsis: Steven, an emotional introvert has recently moved to Chicago from Europe to further his education. Undecided at what his major should be, a class project helps him discover his vocation in life and make the friends he was always yearning for. Nick, a young photographer suffering addiction in multiple forms, has his morals put to the test when he meets Steven. Together they begin A journey of self discovery, love and redemption in the backdrop of modern Midwestern America.What Makes This Film Unique?In the 1980s, Chicago Filmmaker John Hughes brought humanity and honesty to coming of age/adult films and put Chicago, IL on the map as one of the key Midwestern locations in American Cinema. Since John's absence and (in 2009) untimely passing, American cinema has yet to touch upon the honesty & heart John brought to Chicago with his characters' stories. Written Images plans to deliver an honest, heartfelt story of finding yourself, falling in love, and growing up in the likes of Mr. Hughes. Visually, the film is being shot on Mini DV, HDV, & RAW. The film is utilizing the different formats to convey the disarray both character's lives are in. Using these formats will also help utilize post production hard drive space and make the most cost effective workflow possible. Also, because the cameras (like other cheaper digital formats) are so small, we can shoot some of the scenes with a very small setup, without the need of a bigger crew, which requires more space, time, and money.About The Cast & Crew:Mike Krumlauf - Writer/Director/Cinematographer/Editor/Co-ProducerMike was born December 14th, 1990 in Maywood, Illinois. He grew up in Naperville, Illinois the majority of his life, spending a year & a half in Telluride, Colorado from late 2001-2003. Mike's passion with film began when his father gave him a video camera as a Christmas gift in 1999. In 2003, Mike was introduced to low budget DV Filmmaking and the Sony DSR-PD150 camera. He began teaching himself digital cinematography and editing, while constantly experimenting. In 2005, Mike met filmmaker Arin Crumley and acquired the beloved (among low budget filmmakers at the time) Panasonic DVX100A camera.

Our plan is to release the album digitally (in a choice of mp3 or FLAC), on CD and also on vinyl. We know how much gamers value the work of Paul Anthony Romero, as it inspired many people to start learning to play the piano. That's why we have decided to publish a scorebook from the Heroes of Might and Magic series that were performed at the Torun concert. This will be the first book release of this sort, authorised by the composer himself. The event has drawn a crowd of Paul Anthony Romero from all over Europe. To commemorate that magical evening and share it also with those who could not attend it, along with the composer we decided to release an album with the recording of the concert that was captured thanks to the work of professional sound engineers in RATstudios AUDIO. The help and support of you - the fans, will be invaluable to us, bringing all of us closer to success.In 1965, a child named Paul Anthony Romero was born in Southern California. Being a curious boy, he would always keep his eyes open for anything that could catch his attention. In the Romero house, there was one object towards which he grew a particular liking - a piano that his parents bought as a living room decoration. He fell in love with the instrument instantly. Inquisitive as he was at this young age, he pressed one of the keys and… it made a sound! At the age of nine, Paul started to attend music lessons. The beginnings were tough - it was like learning a whole new vocabulary from scratch. After six years of demanding work, he finally started playing concerts. When he was 20, there came a sudden break in his music career. As he says, no one wanted him anymore. It became impossible for Paul to book a venue and, as a result, make a living by playing piano. In 1995, at a friend’s party, he met Rob King, who knew that he used to be a musician. One thing led to another and Paul signed a contract to write 20 minutes of music for a video game called Heroes of Might and Magic. This marked the beginning of Paul’s fabulous journey with the Might and Magic game series.Author Biography: Jan Czarnecki and Przemysław SnarskiIf you’ve ever dreamt of such a unique album, help make our common dream come true.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861326225/the-gosparq-technology?ref=discovery_category_newest,1861326225/the-gosparq-technology,"I am a physics student and outdoor sports enthusiast. I have designed a unique, and novel way to generate renewable energy by harvesting the natural wind energy from descending a mountain on a pair of skis of a snowboard. This is a piece of wearable technology with sketches of the prototype included below.The GoSparq is a prototype of a technology that would be integrated into snow skiing and snowboarding helmets to convert wind energy into chemical energy for charging electronic devices on the go (or on the mountain). The design uses a wind funneling structure to force the air into pathways built into the helmet. The directed wind is the used to rotate a cylindrical turbine to generate an electrical current. The electric current will then charge a battery with a single USB port to charge electronic devices such as the GoPro and cell phones.The money will be used to develop the technology (I will need some trial and error to effectively fit the system into the helmet without the helmet becoming too big and obnoxious in size).I will need to purchase a couple old, used ski helmets, some different designs of micro wind turbines,operablebatteries to be charged. The initial 7k of funding will go to designing the energy system itself. Any additional funds will be used to develop a commercial model.Design for the Prototype: The design I will be utilizing has three main components. These components are: the wind tunneling structure, the wind turbine, and the dis-chargeable battery pack.Wind Tunneling Structure: To preserve the functional integrity of a ski/snowboard helmet,there will be two pairs of open ended wind holes: The first pair will be located on the front of the forehead/top of the head section of the helmet. These holes will funnel the air over the top of the head and to the back of the helmet and direct the air to spin the wind turbine system. The exit holes (the second pair or wind holes) will be on the back of the helmet, allowing the air circulation to funnel through the helmet as the skiier/snowboard rides down the slopes.Micro Wind Turbine System: The air that is flowing through the helmet will be directed to rotate a cylindrical turbine located in the rear of the helmet. The cylindrical design is favored over circular designs to allow for a sleek external design, and it will increase the generation of electrical energy. As the turbine is spun by the directed wind, a generator will produce an electrical current that will charge an electric potential on a battery pack also located in the rear of the helmet.Posterior Battery Pack: The potential difference from the electrical current will be stored in the battery with a single micro USB port. This will allow for the skiier/snowboarder to charge their mobile electronics on the mountain, with a clean and renewable source of energy. ","The major challenge of this project will be the physical integration of the energy harvesting system.  I will need to design the helmet in such a way that it is still appealing to wear, but the helmet must also be functional for safety and charging the battery.This will take some trial and error but wind energy systems are well known and this invention will provide a simple way to generate usable energy while people enjoy some of their favorite outdoor activities.Once a prototype is developed, a commercial model will be pursued.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861326225/first-principle-science-an-educational-youtube-cha?ref=discovery_category_newest,1861326225/first-principle-science-an-educational-youtube-cha,"Hello,My name is Brad Bohus and I am a mathematician and scientist launching an educational YouTube Channel called First Principle Science. The mission of First Principle Science is to provide simple, intuitive, and engaging videos on a variety of scientific topics with accompanying mathematics to every type of viewer. What is first principle science?'First principle' reasoning is taking direct observations and making logical deductions from those observations to draw new conclusions. Science is often presented as an expensive, labor intensive, and time sucking endeavor when that is often not the case. Science at its best is a simple process of simple inquiry driven by genuine curiosity.What is my research background?I am an inventor and research mathematician who has a knack for the basics and the intricate. In 2014, I had obtained a variety of mathematical results that I was not able to formalize until recently. I was a student at Ohio State University when I noticed irreconcilable mathematical inconsistencies within Quantum Field Theory, the presiding mathematical structure used in General Relativity. After presenting my findings to the professors, I was simply not understood so I pursued an entrepreneurial venture (which I now have a patent on, 'CBD Enriched Alcohol' US 9539295) while continuing to formalize my mathematical research. In December 2016, I completed an independent doctoral dissertation in mathematics and physics that has been widely distributed and accepted by the academic community.The premise of my research is simple. I have proven that language is the basis of mathematics and the physics has not properly identifiedentropy in physical theory. That is, what is the difference between walking and dancing, talking and singing, and noise and music? Timing. My dissertation demonstrates the relevance of timing to minimize inefficiency and asserts timing is a fundamental physical phenomenon. Additionally, mathematics has never been formally proven to have foundations. My mathematical arguments prove language (specifically metaphor) is the basis of logical deduction and subsequently all of mathematics.The tenets of my thesis were subsequently directly proven by the discovery of timed dynamic movement of electrons in Vanadium Dioxide by Junqaio Wu and his team out of California Berkeley along with 15 other published studies.Link:http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2017/01/26/electricity-not-heat-flows-in-vanadium-dioxide/ A video produced by BigThink, featuring Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Theil Capital, can be seen at the following link directly discussing my work and its implications in theoretical physics:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw88utUCx9M&t=13s All of my research is conducted from first principle and is a comprehensive across the natural sciences as I have developed an entirely new math subject along with novel proofing methods. My work in mathematics is extensive and demonstrates the foundation of mathematics is language construction. Subsequently, I proved several fundamental theorems of set theory which are introduced here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTUVdXI2vng&t=599sThe dissertation is being edited now and will reach formal publication in 6-12 months (est) and a PDF version is a reward for the campaign. What can a viewer expect from this channel?New content will be added at least once a week. An example episode is previewed in the project video and most episodes will be 2-5 minutes in length on average.Mathematics in schools is often taught as an 'intimidating' subject in accordance with a narrative that alienates a lot of people who want to and can learn math. My aim is to make math research engaging, thought provoking, and useful for all viewers using simple intuition and common sense. The content of the episodes will span all the natural sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics.The channel will begin by addressing and discussing current conundrums in theoretical physics as well as the foundations of mathematics. The new mathematical structure presented on the channel will then be used to model and illuminate simple at home experiments.  What current YouTube channel can I see that yours will resemble?The presentation of my channel will be similar to the style of Infinite Series, PBS Space Time, and Minute Physics. What will the funds be used for?The money will be used for purchasing high quality equipment, editing software (audio and video), and labor. Any money raised past the goal will be used to record/produce sheet music present in the videos and to the publication of my first math textbook. The book will be for a wide audience, experts and enthusiast alike. What is the mission statement of First Principle Science?Common Sense Matters. Many mathematical structures become so polluted with technical jargon that the meaning and utility is lost. It is my mission and the mission of the channel to make common sense the bedrock of mathematical research. ",There should be no risks to this project as it is video content only.  I am already producing episodes for the channel so the channel will occur regardless this funding helps me bring in additional professional equipment and editing for the episodes.

These three young men (Mookie, Jeremiah and Jose) are trying to accomplish something great in their life, but each for a different purpose. You have:Musiah ""Mookie"" Jackenson (25): who was raised in foster care for the majority of his childhood because both of his parents were murdered by gang members. He grew up feeling unloved which developed a lot of hate towards the suspected ""crew"" that murdered his parents, so because of this, he becomes a Blood member to fill the void of not growing up with family to love him. Mookie is still angry about the death of his parents that he starts seeking revenge, but also is trying to find answers as to why his parents were killed in the first place.Jeremiah Wilson (23): who is best friends with Mookie, is wanting more out of life and wants to do more than just work at his minimum wage job. His mother, who is a single parent and a church goer, believes he will not progress in life if he continues affiliating himself with his friends since they are gang members and seems to always get into trouble. Jeremiah in his heart wants to distance himself from everyone and do great for himself but seems to have a hard time letting go of what he is use to.Jose Ortiz(23): Decided to become a Latin King member just like his father who he admired tremendously. Growing up with his father being incarcerated, Jose has always been fascinated with his heritage as well as the Latin King's culture. Jose is seeking to take over leadership of the organization since their current leader for the Latin Kings, he feels, is bringing too much negativity and directing all the members in the path of destruction.Despite the fact these three young men couldn't be any different, the one thing that they do have in common, is the loyalty they have to their family and to their ""brothers"".","My names Safiyah I'm the director,DP, and Editor of this project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/outapp/out-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,outapp/out-app,"OUTOUT is a free social media app with the soul purpose of making day/night outings a whole lot easier. With a simple click of a button notify your friends that you are going out and allow them to join you on your adventure, the app automatically creates a group chat with all the friends that our available and interested, not satisfied yet? within our chatroom we have created tools to allow for location votes as well as an average budget generator so you will be able to get an estimate of the expense which await you before hand. Afraid that know one will be available? use our calendar tool to set a date ahead of time to notify people when you are planing to go out. Bored of being around the same people ? want to make new friends and build relationships ? Then simply change settings to broadcast all, allowing both your friends and followers to join your outing, afraid you may not get along with the followers that join you? Not to worry we have made it easy for you to accept and decline all interested followers to your group based upon whether you feel that they your typical type of company.What our app offers OUT allows you to create on going traditions for example a user could create group called picnic Tuesday and over time build up the participants who join. Each group created has the ability to be private and public. The difference between the two are that a private group will only be shown and available to your friends where as a public group will be available to your friends and followers however you may choose whether which followers join simply by viewing their profile and clicking accept of decline depending of whether their personality appeals to you.OUT offers a great discover section which provides different deals and promotions around you. This keeps each user updated with what's going on around their area and prevents them from ever running out of outing ideas.Our app will frequently do giveaways and reward giving in the form of fully paid experiences and holidays to our frequent users. If interested we go in to more detail as you scroll down to are leaderboard example.Memories (Posts)We allow each user to post and store as many memories as they want, labelling them by year to month and day making it easier for them to organize. A (memory) is simply a post however as our app is based upon friends and adventure we feel that memories is the best way to solidify the basis of the app. What we mean by this is that other social media apps such as Instagram use the word post and even through something so small can make all the difference, a lot of Instagram users tend to have a lot of images in which the user is alone or taking a selfie and as mentioned before the basis of OUT is friends and family in conclusion when are the best memories made? Usually with friends and family.Ways the app can be used Our app can be used in different ways depending on your agenda, we go into more detail as you scroll down, however a short insight of what that means is that it can be used for personal use in which we believe is for planing and organize days, nights or short break plans with friends, family or even work colleges. Or it can be used in a promotional way for people who are involved in event planing/organizing, club and bar promoters or furthermore DJs who are trying to boost their audience by notify people where they will be performing.The difference between each approach depending on the user will simply be as using the app for personal use your main focus will be building your friends count. Where as when using the app for promotional use you would focus on building your followers up and generating a large audience to promote what ever event you my be hosting or promoting.APP FEATURESFEEDDISSCOVERCHATROOMNOTIFICATIONSPROFILEACHIEVEMENTSLEADERBOARDLOCATION (SETTINGS)REWARDSFeedThis is our app feed section, this is where you can view your friends memories from their outings, nights out and adventures. The prototype image above shows you our app unique custom design look however if users prefer the classic Instagram square look that can be changed simply by going to the settings.When viewing the feed you will have the option to access the leaderboards, upload memories and furthermore post actual time snap shots of your night out (storyboard).This image gives you the general look of our default setting for a personal use users, however unlike instagram and Nightset we give each individual user a selective amount of freedom for their layout and profile deign.Profile Typespromotional basedThe promotional based layout will automatically set your profile settings in an alinement that will make it easier to reach out to an audience best suiting your addenda. This layout is best for users looking to promote events fundraisers and experiences. This layout would be highly recommended for promoters, Event hosts, DJs fundraising and charity organizers.This layout is designed to help focus on building the users followers and gaining large audiences.Personal basedThe personal based layout will set up each user with the default look which we have decided will best suit the average individual use. However with this layout setting each user  will be given a lot more personal design freedom to start off with allowing their page to have it’s own distinct look.This layout will be recommend for a high percentage of users.This layout is primarily for personal use, for users who don’t intend on promoting or advertising events. When choosing this type of layout it will also adjust the settings. For example privacy setting will play a large part in this, only allowing friends full access to view your profile wheres as your followers will only be able to view the selective few things in which you choose.Of course just by choosing one of the two profile types does not mean that it is set and can not be changed at anytime, furthermore users are free to mix layout designs and settings between the two profile types.Profile AboutOur profile about section is more or less an extended bio. As one of our Apps main purposes in which is to allow people to make friends and build new relationship, we feel that this section is important to allow each user to get to know the person they are following a bit better, furthermore this will allow friends to discover things that they may have not known about you. The best thing about this feature we provide is the fact that you could potential find someone who has mores or less the same interest as you, allowing you to build a long term relationship with somewhere you may not have noticed otherwise.When deigning our about section we deiced to set 4 section in which the user would not be able to change these section are (Top 5, Interest, Me And Bucket List ) we believe these for sections will allow each profile viewer to get the best understanding of what each user is about and their overall personality. The top 5 section is basically an overview of what each user believes is their favorite this could vary from favorite singing, to actor, country or  movie etc.. The interest section speaks for its self just identify what you are interested in. Our Me section is simply for each user to add information such as age, birthday, country in which they where born etc.. Last but not least is our bucket list section in which you will be able to put all the things you have yet planned to do this will give user an example of how adventuress you are.Don't let this short description fool you though, as shown in the image each user will be a able to add and delete and name their own personalized sections if they feel that the prime sections do not allow them to tell their viewers enough about themselves.If you feel worried about too much information be accessed by large audience, not to worry you can change that via, our privacy settings allowing you to set it, just so  your friends can view, or even taken it a step further by allowing the selective friends in which you choose.Trophies Our trophy case is a great way for each user to keep track of their general activity. Each trophy signifies that a user has gained an achievement. We feel that this is a fun way to acknowledge and thank each individual for their frequent activity. The trophy case will be allowed to be viewed by every user whether, or not an individual will want to share how the trophy was earned will be completely up to them this can be adjusted via, our privacy settings.To keep user interested we will introduce new trophies yearly and reward those with the highest collection. DISCOVERDiscover is by far our most advance section within our app. We have given users a wide amount room to discover new things to do, great sites to view and hot places to go to. The idea behind this was to give people guidance whether they had ran out of outing ideas or may have not been familiar with the great opportunities around them.To make spreading the word a lot easier, what ever you discover whether it may be a restaurant club or concert simply click share too... and have the option to send it to a friend, group or alert people that you think would be interested and allow the app to generate a group chat based on all the people who have responding to that alert with (interested). If in a group chat and your discussing with the people within that group on where to go simply find somewhere to go through (discover) narrow it down to around 2 options and allow the group to vote in which they feel would be the best choice via our voting tool.Discover sections:Events Festivals Concerts Clubs BarsDining PromotionsCinemas ExperiencesShort BreaksSpa & BeautyNew FacesNEW FACESTo give you a bit more information and depth about our discover section and it’s abilities we’ve chosen our (new faces) section as our example.Now the great thing about this section is that it can be used in various ways to elaborate, whether the users intentions may be to make new friends, find a date and potentially build a relationship or even find someone who is in the same line of work as you and could potentially help you to get to where you want to be our preferred example of this would be (Promoters, event planners and DJs).To make each users search experience easier and more accurate we have applied a filter to help narrow the individual search. As shown in our prototype a few of the filters you can play around with our users (occupation, location, gender and interest) etc..BenefitsThe benefits Unlike dating apps such as (Tinder) where it’s sort of a mix match we allow you to find people with similar interests and preferences that best suit you, furthermore we allow you to find people within the same line of work. This provides loads of breathing room and space for conversation in other words a comfortable first date.CHATROOMThis image shows what it would look like to be in a group chat.This particular image highlights some of our key tools such as the voting and the budget generator. All in which are designed and there to make a group outing all but easier.CHATROOM (GROUP INFO)This image show what it would look like to click on group info.This gives you a range of group details from number of participants to upcoming events.LeaderboardWe added a leaderboard to keep all user interested and engaged with the app, each year we will reward the top 10 users in all categories with rewards based on the amount in the prize pot. The prize pot will be split between all the top 10 leading individuals. The rewards we give will be all exclusive outing experiences based on the sum of money in which they receive. For example an award could be an all paid holiday to Greece for the user and 3 other friends.How will we make it fair for everyone?Each year all points will be reset however the users will remain in their position following the previous year until another users has gained more points. Are reasoning for this is we don’t want the same people wining constantly each year and would like to give all users an opportunity to win.How to earn points Thereare various ways in which a user can earn points from earning trophies to gaining followers and friends as well as creating open events and gaining a large audience of people who are interested.Each action will ultimately gain a user a different amount of points. For example if gaining a follower gives you 5 points earning a trophy will give you 50 points as the difficulty out of the two varies.This will prevent people such as celebrities from rising to the top based upon their large fan base.Leaderboard categories: Friends Country World GroupsWhat will your donation be used for?The money raised will be used to finalize the app, this stage will consists of the following (coding, final design and the app launch)","Our main challenge which we had identified at an early stage of development and design. Was creating a design layout that would allow new users to feel comfortable and familiar with the controls and shortcuts, however at the same time  give our app it's very own unique design allowing us to differentiate our selfs from the other leading social media apps. To over come this potential challenge we have begun to allow our audience to play around with our prototype and give us feedback. The majority audience that we are reaching out to consist of students at a university.The risk that we face fall under the marketing sector. we understand that when advertising any product if not clear enough, the product may lose it's purpose. This is small risk due to the way we have designed the app although we are not blind to the fact that it is still a possibility.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/outapp/out-the-app-designed-to-bring-people-together?ref=discovery_category_newest,outapp/out-the-app-designed-to-bring-people-together,"What Is OUTOUT is a free social media app with the soul purpose of making day/night outings a whole lot easier.

OUT will remove the obsession of sharing self portraits and living a lie to gain attention from followers. Our motto is (you can’t create a memory if no one is there to share it with you).Story behind the ConceptSocial media apps today are no longer social, people are using these platforms to self promote themselves, to convince people that they are living their best life, furthermore sharing degrading posts of the chance of 10 seconds of fame.However it’s the people who own and control these social media platforms fault more than anyone else as they allow people to buy likes, followers and views. The very same people who created a concept to bring people together are the same people who are allowing these platforms to loose their way by allowing these platforms to turn in to the center of marketing and advertisement.Live feedDisplayShare MemoriesDiscoverDisplayThe Apps Discover section will consist of the following:This is our new faces section with a custom designed filter which will potential help users find other users suited to their personal preference.ChatroomDisplayTo plan an outing click on the calendar icon and begin.

The money raised from our campaign will go towards the final stage of bringing the app to life which will be coding allowing us to bring a finished product to both the App Store and play store.The biggest challenge the app will face is getting people ton understand that this is not just another repeat social media app it is so much more, the basis and general idea of social is what the app concept was built upon and we tend to keep it that way. its not about how good you make your life look it's about the best moments throughout your life remembering them and letting people see who they were shared with. that's the message will want to promote."

Abbiamo nel nostro repertorio varie collezioni storiche di abiti originali -partendo dal 1700 in poi-, cappelli di tutte le foggie, borsette, guanti, ombrellini, ventagli, intimo, paramenti sacri e gioielli; oltre a materie prime -sempre originali- come ad esempio bottoni -collezione superiore 100mila pezzi-, fibbie, pizzi -centinaia di km-, velette per cappelli, calotte, passamanerie, nastri in raso, velluto e cotone, guarnizioni di piume, tessuti di ogni genere e tutti i materiali e accessori che servono per creare un abito, tutto rigorosamente made in Italy.Since we do know the complexity of our project we shall carry it out systematically: firstly, we are going to catalogue the items of our sewing shop and only then, we will try to achieve the final goal in the amount of 3.5 million euros and the establishment of the Museum of the History and Fashion.Dal momento che siamo consapevoli della complessità del nostro progetto vorremmo portarlo a termine in modo sistematico: in primo luogo, iniziando a catalogare gli articoli presenti nella sartoria e solo allora, cercheremo di raggiungere l'obiettivo finale (per un importo di 3,5 milioni di euro) l'istituzione del Museo della storia e della moda.We want to establish an interactive museum with a sewing lab inside of it, where it will be possible to design and create tailor-made dresses for our customers and for tourists as well – you will actually have the chance to choose a dress, have it tailor-made and shipped all over the world. We want to give our customers the chance to take part in sewing therapy labs or sewing lessons, which will be organized following a specific timetable.Il museo non sarà statico, ma avrà al suo interno un laboratorio sartoriale per la progettazione e realizzazione di capi e accessori su misura, per i clienti abituali ma anche per i turisti, -infatti abbiamo intenzione di creare la possibilità di scegliere un abito, farlo cucire su misura e spedire in qualunque parte del mondo-.Vi sarà inoltre la possibilità di seguire corsi di sartoterapia e lezioni di cucito in orari prestabiliti all’interno del polo museale.We do believe that with a close partnership with tourist authorities, tour operators and schools our number of visits will be considerably higher: our museum will become the core of a cultural, anthropological, sociological fashion experience.

Picture being somewhere and seeing a sign that says ""Adventure Golf"" or ""Crazy Golf"" and being lured in to the idea of windmills, clowns and outrageous courses that are visually pleasing and fun to play. Then you arrive and see that the course you just paid £15 for is actually just some bumps on a small course with poorly defined sides, this is a disappointment that we need to rid ourselves of, and create something far more spectacular. This is where I come in, I have an old family friend that can create virtually anything he puts his mind to, there are plenty of empty venues in the town that I live in and above all I have the vision for a fantastic new crazy golf course.....but I have none of the money. That is where YOU come in! Pledge as much or little as you want, if this takes off I would like to keep expanding and soon you may even have a fantastic new crazy golf course near you!! My idea is fun for anyone, and will bring a smile to many faces, hopefully brightening up the dull town that I live in.","There are obvious risks to this plan in the form of ""Will there be enough customers?"", which if my vision is pulled off there definitely will be, it will be aesthetically pleasing and as time goes by I will reinvest in the business to make it even better!  Midweek deals and a loyalty system should pull in more regular customers as well!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1930149700/the-riddlers-lair?ref=discovery_category_newest,1930149700/the-riddlers-lair,"I would just like to bring something fun to a world of working constantly, and ever decreasing real life interaction. My goal is to expand as rapidly as possible, and this kick-start would be the first step to bringing something fun to more places. The rooms will be challenging and fun, with as many contraptions and secrets possible in order to be engaging and challenging. Competitions between various establishments would be promoted with a grand prize for the best escape artists! School away days would be encouraged to get the minds of youngsters engaged in logical thought and problem solving. The possibilities are endless, all I need is you :-) with that in mind please donate as little or as much as possible, you could help achieve a dream today.Thanks","The key risks around this project are customers, if we have too few then this will not succeed, however after a good few days of crunching numbers I determined that the risks minimal.  Given a premises with 4 rooms each with a capacity for 6 people the potential for earnings will be maximised.  I am a part qualified management accountant, and have a good skill set to judge the risks and rewards involved.  Given this I am confident in the business being a success and thriving in the current marketplace."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oregonsports/oregon-sports-almanac?ref=discovery_category_newest,oregonsports/oregon-sports-almanac,"The book is a collection of information from professional teams, college programs and high school events that conclude in early summer, likely after the college baseball season ends. There's information on the team history of the Blazers, Timbers, Thorns and Winterhawks. There's information on college teams from the Ducks and Beavers to community college programs. There's results from high school state championships, and results from past championships with league standings for many sports. And, there's information on every amateur sport we could find such as archery, badminton, curling, racquetball, wrestling clubs, etc. All in one book you'll look through again and again as years go by - until the next one is printed and delivered!Plus, you get the print edition of Oregonsports Journal, which will update the state on features that usually get missed by daily or weekly papers due to lack of space. It all supports the daily efforts of oregonsports.com to become the daily news resource of record for Oregon.SAMPLE COVER DRAFT USING CURRENT/PAST PHOTOS:","Our challenges are corralling all the information that's fit to print - a big task for a small group. But, we're counting on finding volunteers, interns, passionate people who want to promote athletics and the state in an extraordinary way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oregonsports/oregonsports-programming-network-mobile-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,oregonsports/oregonsports-programming-network-mobile-app,"It's a wonderful trip sports fans are headed for through the stories, videos and community connections of the Oregonsports Programming Network Mobile App, coming in December, and the redesigned www.oregonsports.com set to premiere Feb. 1, 2021.All that time spent on a phone following ESPN five times a day ... well, now you'll have an in-state competitor for that time as we produce and update stories throughout the day and into the night - Blazers, Timbers, Ducks, Beavers, Thorns, Winterhawks, even those pesky college and high school kids. They're all newsworthy, and entertaining, too.What the state needs to bring the people and teams together as a stronger community is a digitally-focused media company with a stellar Mobile App and freshly designed website. That's the Oregonsports Programming Network, along with oregonsports.com.Our Mobile App Campaign revolves around digital viewers becoming members of a statewide network that works with businesses - those that have an inclination to support teams, leagues, events that make up the sports community. With enough of an annual membership base, they'll be motivated to provide discounts on their products and services, which will make that membership more valuable every year for both members and businesses.MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS•Discounts on products and services from Business Network Members for 18 months.•Direct e-mail contact on potential rewards and discounts as businesses become members.• Free subscription for three months of OSPN content for three months beginning in February.• Print copy of the Oregonsports Journal Class of 2021 Almanac edition in July.And, that's statewide, so if you're ever on the road and want to support the sports business community, you'll have a resource to consult, from Coos Bay to Medford to Eugene, Salem, Portland, Bend or Pendleton. And, every town in between with a sports bar.Growing a member base through this campaign is the first step toward getting the financial resources to not only build the Mobile App, but staff the company behind it.Membership through our Mobile App campaign comes along with subscription benefits that are free for three months. That $10 per month fee is akin to what folks pay for Netflix or Hulu; services that get used regularly, but not likely on a daily basis. That's on your TV, though, not on your phone. And, they're not focused on Oregon or on sports. That's where OSPN comes in.With a revenue model based on members and subscribers, we're set to do great things for Oregon sports fans, not only with coverage of news and events, but through programming that coverage, too.How often has the state high school cross country championships had pre-event coverage that included ... a former state champion - or two? On video? And then they helped cover that event. That's because traditional media coverage is just that - traditional. We're going to program coverage so you'll want to check in on your phone or through the website daily, sometimes hourly.As a subscriber, you'll have access to all that coverage. And, that's across the state. Without needing to print a newspaper, our distribution area is ... where our content is - across the state. We'll have the ability to tailor it to your area through the ever-increasing magic of computer language. And, not just geographically, but by interest. Table tennis, cycling, badminton, water polo, bowling - our subscriber base will allow us to provide coverage of all those activities and put them front and center when you want.Our subscription base will have a bit of traditional circulation to it in that newspapers aren't meant for one person, but an address. We're working on how to allow families to pay one fee for the service rather than two or three or four, etc.That means we'll be hiring in a profession that's been hit hard by technology.SUBSCRIBER BENEFITS BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY• Access to exclusive content.• Push notifications on breaking news through the Mobile App.• Print copy of the Oregonsports Journal Class of 2021 Almanac edition in July.There's plenty of pro and major college sports in Oregon, and that's where our programming begins, with coverage just like you get from any other news outlet in the area - from print to cable. There's blogs and podcasts for this level of athletics, but have one of them ever talked to the Portland Thorns support group, the Rose City Riveters, about finding a sister club in Europe because so many US players head to teams there during the off-season? And, we paid for a couple of their members to go to Europe (when intercontinental travel returns) and check into a few clubs as part of original programming. That's what having a strong subscriber base will turn into.And, that's just the beginning.• Bowling could use a statewide tour. We can help make that happen through financial motivation, then cover it like ESPN covers the PBA.• Oregon's casinos have poker tournaments don't they? We can cover those.• Imagine a cross country relay race around ... a 400-meter track. Maybe 100 laps with pit stops, NASCAR-style. The PDX 100. We can create that and cover it live like ESPN covers the X Games.• Roseburg and Tigard played to a 14-all tie in the state championship football game 30 years ago. Maybe they'd have some fun settling that tie on the football field, or on the golf links, or bowling alley or poker table. If it's fun, we'll work to make it happen.And, this company is locally owned, something none of the largest newspapers can boast anymore.All this planning begins with this Membership campaign to fund the development of the Member network and creation of the Mobile App that will change Oregon sports coverage. Your pledge will make that happen.",The biggest challenge we might face is hiring ... from writers and editors to videographers and advertising managers.

Being on The Voice was an incredible experience for so many reasons. 1) I got to work with some of my favorite Artists/Idols, 2) I got to perform and share my passion for music with Millions of people all over the World! and 3) I got to meet all of You. YOU, who reached out to share your personal stories of struggle and triumph and let me know that my story inspired you to not give up on your dreams. It's because of you that I am creating this EP, to share my message of Hope and Determination. To empower others to create a life they love.The Objective: In addition to making great music, there are several necessary aspects to a successful music release. They include: Marketing, Promotion, Touring, Merchandise & Distribution, to name a few. And all of those things cost ££. The objective of this campaign is the raise the necessary funds for Recording, PR & Touring. If we hit our $40K goal, we can finish recording our EP, cover the full scope of a PR/Marketing plan for the singles and hit the road with my band to perform for you lovely people. Yay! The Facts: Making music isn't cheap, especially for an Independent Artist. Promoting it and Touring is even less cheap. That's why I have partnered with some incredible musicians, producers, videographers and promoters who share my goal of creating a high quality product on a conservative budget. And that's where You come in...The Budget: The £30K raised in this campaignBUDGET BREAKDOWN: £15,000 is allocated to the Recording Budget to include: Production & Engineering Fees, Studio Musicians, Studio Time, Recording, Mixing and Mastering, £5K will go toward the PR & Promotion Budget leading up to the release of each single, £6K will go toward our fixed regional touring costs, approx. £4K will go to the creation of Prizes and Shipping, 5-8%, or £2K, will go to KickStarter's fee for providing a safe platform and services. Anything this budget does Not Cover, such as Distribution, Merchandising and Misc costs, I will continue to fund personally. Did Someone Say PRIZES..?!? As a thank you for your contribution, there are Prizes at various donation levels. Pick your Poison! ","The Risks & Challenges of this project are simple: If we do Not reach our goal of £30K by the end of the 31-Day campaign, All Donations will be returned to the Backers, and we won't be able to do what we've set out to accomplish. Fear Not. We can do this."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1690045156/the-cave-paleo-beastro?ref=discovery_category_newest,1690045156/the-cave-paleo-beastro,"Welcome to The Cave Paleo Beastro!With your help, I will open The Cave Paleo Beastro, a new and exciting concept in South Edmonton. The Cave will be open for breakfast and lunch offering a new Paleo only menu, great coffee and a bakery!For those not familiar with Paleo eating, here is a brief explanation:Basically, ""If the cavemen didn't eat it, neither should you"". Paleo eatingruns on the same foods our hunter-gather ancestors supposedly ate: fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, and nuts. ""By following these nutritional guidelines, we put our diet more in line with the evolutionary pressures that shaped our current genetics, which in turn positively influences health and well being,"" says Loren Cordain, PhD, professor of health and exercise science at Colorado State University and author of The Paleo Diet. He says the diet lessens the body's glycemic load, has a healthy ratio of saturated-to-unsaturated fatty acids, increases vitamin and nutrient consumption, and contains an optimal balance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.The biggest question I always get is ""Does it still taste good?"" My answer is ""Of course it does!!"" You can still enjoy most of things you love to eat, just in a healthier way. Not everything is the same, but in most cases, you will never be able to tell that there is no dairy, gluten or soy in what you are eating. That is the beauty of The Cave! Why a Paleo Restaurant?Jennifer and I love good food and we love checking out new restaurants wherever we are. The biggest issue is we continually have to see if they have a menu for people with dietary restrictions. You see, Jennifer can't have gluten, dairy or soy. Basically, eating air is her only alternative when we go out. Chefs do not want to substitute items and just eliminate them from dishes. This takes away from the overall meal and experience. Also, the others at the table feel guilty eating a wonderful meal as she sits and watches. I want to give those people a chance to enjoy those foods they can't get anywhere else. Sure, there are a few Paleo or Gluten free options on a menu, but too few to make it worth the while of going out. The Cave will provide everyone the opportunity to taste great fresh food and feel good about their bodies after eating. The ConceptThe Cave will be a small, cozy dining experience. Just 40 seats showcasing wood and stone accents and an open kitchen. A bakery that will offer 5-6 different types of bread each day as well as tasty pastries and baked goods. Excellent coffee brought to you by experienced Baristas and a full breakfast and lunch menu to satisfy almost everyone's needs.We will be open Monday to Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, Saturday 8:00am to 2:00pm and Sundays 10:00am to 2:00pm. Sunday will feature brunch service with two seatings at 10:00am and 12:00pm.The Cave will also offer a monthly Chef's Menu Dinner once a month where you will be treated to a five course meal and wine pairings. If there is enough interest, The Cave will open for dinner on the weekends. Also, The Cave will offer a take home meal program, where customers can go online or in the restaurant and order a meal to take home. It will be ready for you to pick up at the end of the day, so you can just go home after a long day at work and not have to worry about creating a meal. In the future, there will be frozen meal options. And, there might be a gelato bar in the summer months, if we can make it work! The MenuThe menu will have breakfast and lunch items daily. There will be The Cave staples, like The Caveman Breakfast consisting of eggs (done your way), fresh pork belly bacon, homemade sausage, ham and toast or biscuit. Or The Cave Cubano Sandwich with fresh made Porchetta, homemade Salami, Ham, Pickles and house made mustard, grilled on our house made French bread. The menu will have new items rotated on a weekly/monthly basis, so that it stays fresh and that our customers have an opportunity to try something new every time they come in and dine. Now, there is always an issue when it comes to Paleo and alcohol. There are those that say it doesn't fit with the Paleo Diet and those that say there are exceptions. At The Cave, we will offer Organic Paleo Approved wines and Gluten Free Beer. You don't have to drink alcohol as we will have our full featured coffee menu and other beverage options to tantalize your taste buds.LocationThe Cave will be located in the new Allendale East Professional Building located at 61 Ave and Calgary Trail North in Edmonton, Alberta. We will be located on the main floor with access to 35,000 cars driving by each day. There is plenty of parking and access to the restaurant through the lobby. ","The RisksWell, that one is easy to explain.  The biggest risk is that I have given up a six figure income to pursue my dream.  I feel so passionate about this that I gave up everything to start The Cave.  All of the money I ever saved is gone and this is my last shot.  If this doesn't work, then I give up on cooking, FOREVER! Anyone who knows me understands that I care about food and people.  I just want to do something very special in the city that has been my home for the past 48 years.  There are also a lot of risks when you open a restaurant.  Many will fail within the first 8-10 months and that is always a risk when venturing out into this market.  Food costs, sourcing the freshest ingredients and rising labour costs are another issue.  By doing my due diligence and research, I feel that we have a plan to combat these obstacles.Finally, the word ""FAIL"" is not in my vocabulary.  I refuse to let it be part of my life.  I will work so hard to have this dream come to fruition and I hope you will join me on this new and exciting journey.  Together, we can make this happen!  Thank you for your support!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1690045156/the-cave-paleo-beastro-ii?ref=discovery_category_newest,1690045156/the-cave-paleo-beastro-ii,"My last Kickstarter campaign failed as I reached for the moon when I should have reached for something smaller!!

The Cave will be open for breakfast and lunch offering a new Paleo only menu, great coffee and a bakery!For those not familiar with Paleo eating, here is a brief explanation:Basically, ""If the cavemen didn't eat it, neither should you"".  Paleo eating runs on the same foods our hunter-gather ancestors supposedly ate: fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, and nuts. ""By following these nutritional guidelines, we put our diet more in line with the evolutionary pressures that shaped our current genetics, which in turn positively influences health and well being,"" says Loren Cordain, PhD, professor of health and exercise science at Colorado State University and author of The Paleo Diet. He says the diet lessens the body's glycemic load, has a healthy ratio of saturated-to-unsaturated fatty acids, increases vitamin and nutrient consumption, and contains an optimal balance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.The biggest question I always get is ""Does it still taste good?""  My answer is ""Of course it does!!"" You can still enjoy most of things you love to eat, just in a healthier way.  Not everything is the same, but in most cases, you will never be able to tell that there is no dairy, gluten or soy in what you are eating.  That is the beauty of The Cave!  Jennifer and I love good food and we love checking out new restaurants wherever we are.  The biggest issue is we continually have to see if they have a menu for people with dietary restrictions.  You see, Jennifer can't have gluten, dairy or soy.  Basically, eating air is her only alternative when we go out.  Chefs do not want to substitute items and just eliminate them from dishes.  This takes away from the overall meal and experience.  Also, the others at the table feel guilty eating a wonderful meal as she sits and watches.  I want to give those people a chance to enjoy those foods they can't get anywhere else.  Sure, there are a few Paleo or Gluten free options on a menu, but too few to make it worth the while of going out.  The Cave will provide everyone the opportunity to taste great fresh food and feel good about their bodies after eating.  The Cave will be a small, cozy dining experience.  Just 40 seats showcasing wood and stone accents and an open kitchen.  A bakery that will offer 5-6 different types of bread each day as well as tasty pastries and baked goods.  Excellent coffee brought to you by experienced Baristas and a full breakfast and lunch menu to satisfy almost everyone's needs.We will be open Monday to Friday from 7:30am to 5:00pm, Saturday 8:00am to 2:00pm and Sundays 10:00am to 2:00pm.  Sunday will feature brunch service with two seatings at 10:00am and 12:00pm. The Cave will also offer a monthly Chef's Menu Dinner once a month where you will be treated to a five course meal and wine pairings.  If there is enough interest, The Cave could open for dinner on the weekends.  Also, The Cave will offer a take home meal program, where customers can go online or in the restaurant and order a meal to take home. It will be ready for you to pick up at the end of the day, so you can just go home after a long day at work and not have to worry about creating a meal.  In the future, there will be frozen meal options.  And, there might be a gelato bar in the summer months, if we can make it work!  The menu will have breakfast and lunch items daily.  There will be The Cave staples, like The Caveman Breakfast consisting of eggs (done your way), fresh pork belly bacon, homemade sausage, ham and toast or biscuit.  Or The Cave Cubano Sandwich with fresh made Porchetta, homemade Salami, Ham, Pickles and house made mustard, grilled on our house made French bread.  The menu will have new items rotated on a weekly/monthly basis, so that it stays fresh and that our customers have an opportunity to try something new every time they come in and dine.  Now, there is always an issue when it comes to Paleo and alcohol.  There are those that say it doesn't fit with the Paleo Diet and those that say there are exceptions.  At The Cave, we will offer Organic Paleo Approved wines and Gluten Free Beer.  You don't have to drink alcohol as we will have our full featured coffee menu and other beverage options to tantalize your taste buds.The Cave will be located in the new Allendale East Professional Building located at 61 Ave and Calgary Trail North in Edmonton, Alberta.  We will be located on the main floor with access to 35,000 cars driving by each day.  There is plenty of parking and access to the restaurant through the lobby.  ","The RisksWell, that one is easy to explain. The biggest risk is that I have given up a six figure income to pursue my dream. I feel so passionate about this that I gave up everything to start The Cave. All of the money I ever saved is gone and this is my last shot. If this doesn't work, then I give up on cooking, FOREVER!Anyone who knows me understands that I care about food and people. I just want to do something very special in the city that has been my home for the past 48 years.There are also a lot of risks when you open a restaurant. Many will fail within the first 8-10 months and that is always a risk when venturing out into this market.Food costs, sourcing the freshest ingredients and rising labour costs are another issue. By doing my due diligence and research, I feel that we have a plan to combat these obstacles.Finally, the word ""FAIL"" is not in my vocabulary. I refuse to let it be part of my life. I will work so hard to have this dream come to fruition and I hope you will join me on this new and exciting journey. Together, we can make this happen!Thank you for your support!"

The player begins the game with a basic Glock 19 and has access to a basic melee attack via a combat knife or a bicycle chain as well as a maximum of 6 hand grenades. As the Smash monkey fights the invading zombie Trumps, he receives points. These points are used to buy upgraded weapons, perks, and access different parts of the map. Some maps have different variations of zombie Trumps that spawn on specific waves, like crawler Trump zombies, voodoo Trumps and Mexican Trump zombies among others.Zombie Trumps enter from outside the playable map via barricaded entries and are trying to attack the Smash Monkey while shouting various signature Trump catch phrases such as ""Grab ""em by the pussy"", ""You're Fired!"" ""Build the Wall"" and ""Bigly"" etc. As the rounds progress, difficulty increases and the zombie Trumps can remove barricades faster and get much more aggressive. The player is awarded points for replacing barricades as well as killing zombie Trumps.The game has numerous perks that can be bought that awards players a certain ability or power and can upgrade to numerous weapons and much more gruesome melee weapons that can be used on large groups such as a laser chainsaw and a gas powered 3 headed spiked mace.The target finish date is August 2019. The target platform for this game is touch devices running both iOS and Android.After spending the last few years (YEARS!) playing Call of Duty Zombies mode and growing up obsessively playing the arcade version of Rampage, we feel like Zombie Trump Monkey Smash is a great way to combine two of my favorite genre of video games (Smash & Shoot) and create an action-packed game that will also have some gruesome Zombie Trump action, clever references to classic Zombie films & TV shows and a wicked sense of humor.We're going to cram the game full of outrageous weapon upgrades, cool achievements, a killer soundtrack and colorful Zombie Trump characters that will keep fans playing for hours.","Game development is not for the faint of heart. We understand this and we're cool with it. We are die hard gamers at heart and this is a passion project. We will see this through to the end and will complete this project come hell or high water by utilizing donated funds and our own personal funds and blood, sweat & tears. Music licensing for the master track recordings may pose some problems but we are also working with a producer and producing our own tracks."

Most everyone is familiar with Muhammad Ali. And his fight pictures are legendary. My coverage is not of the fights but of the preparation before the fights, the camaraderie with his manager and trainers, his workouts in Miami Beach at the 5th Street Gym; walking around and riding around Miami Beach. It was a different time. And I include my recollections of being with ""The Champ"", who to me was a big pussycat, as friendly and fun as you can imagine. Besides my recollections, we've recruited 10 to 12 writers and a few of Ali's opponents to pen some remarks about their association with him, good or bad….. but certainly interesting. 1970 and 1971 was an exciting time….. not without it's ups and downs.     My super editors - JC Gabel and John Buffalo Mailer (both highly experienced)- have enlisted some great writers who are interested in providing never before seen reflections on Ali plus more - these will be interspersed throughout the book.Gay TaleseStanley CrouchJames TobackTaki TheadoracopulousKevin PowellKostya KennedyDick and Doris Goodwinand more........      There will be three versions of the book - a General Edition, a Collector's Edition and an Artist's Edition- all editions will be hardcover. The Collector's Edition and Artist's Edition will be numbered and signed (see details below). There will only be 500 copies of the Collector's Edition and 200 copies of the Artist's Edition. All of these books will be printed to the highest standards on high quality fine art paper.And they will be designed by the award-winning designer, Aaron Drucker (who also designed my last book, The Cozumel Diary).The Project:      In the Seventies, I lived in Florida and was on contract to numerous magazines for assignments in the South. Camera Five, my agency in New York, called in September 1970 with assignments for various magazines (Time, Life, Paris Match, etc) to photograph Muhammad Ali working out in preparation for his upcoming fight in Atlanta in October. Ali hadn't fought in nearly 4 years due to his suspension by the boxing commission for his refusal to be inducted in the draft. He worked out at promoter Chris Dundee's 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach under the guidance of his trainer Angelo Dundee.      I introduced myself to Angie and Ali, and they made me feel totally at home, and paid me no more attention, perfect for a working photographer. In the next few days I got to know Ali by just being around. He treated me like a friend, not one of the press that were always hounding him.      I went on walks with him, showed up in the dark before dawn when he was running around Miami in his pre-dawn workout; rode around in the limo with him.      He had a great sense of humor and was much fun, especially watching him tweak the sports writers who mostly seemed to be antagonistic towards him. We were close in age, far apart in life, but together we had fun.   Ali was BIG! He was INTIMIDATING! He was a hell of a lot of FUN….    The few photos of mine that were published in the magazines were overshadowed by the actual fight photos…. which I never covered; and were soon forgotten. I photographed Ali again a couple years later in Los Angeles at a benefit track meet that he sponsored. He still remembered me. After that the negatives sat in my files until recently when I started looking at what I have photographed over the years. There are over 50 rolls of Tri-X from those early years. I have edited the contact sheets and chosen 200 iconic images to choose from for this project.      Looking back, we photographers always wish we had shot more. I'm satisfied that I got the best images that were there. Motor drives don't make great photos, photographers do. I shot what I saw and I captured some great moments. Never to be relived…. the 5th Street Gym isn't even there anymore, having been demolished in the Nineties.      This book will be done the way I want, showing off my images of Muhammad Ali the best way possible.

In observing what does and does not entertain our test audiences during this production, it's become apparent that certain elements of our pilot reached short of the standards we aim for, due in part to financing and certain disagreements during the storyboarding process. With this next episode we plan on realising our potential in ways we weren't conscious of before, with robust, nuanced delivery in voice acting, audio that always has foreground and background, depth of field and an engaging range of motion in storyboards, more visual and audio gags, and better understanding and exploration of the relationship between the characters.ARTISTS LEAVING MID-PRODUCTIONThis caused minor delays during production (though not in the same way as the financing issues).Work contracts will be in place this time around that ensure this does not happen again. The contracts will go both ways, of course, protecting artists by guaranteeing pay and nullifying the contract if payment is not delivered.LACK OF AUDIENCE:This may have been the case five years ago, when violence, irony and general adult themes were less common in mainstream animation. Thanks to the headway made by the Adult Swim subnetwork, Archer and Cartoon Network's Adventure Time, there is now a solid 18-35 animation audience. Archer has even disproved the theory that animated shows can only survive in groups, riding to success on the FX channel. Admittedly the UK is still catching up to the US on this, but luckily we're currently online-only and can entertain an international audience.The underlying theme in our cartoon is the importance and fragility of memory, which extends at one time or another to every individual character. While we realise that the episode we created doesn't always maintain this concept - it'll be farcical at one moment and violent the next - further episodes focus heavily on character growth. We hope our series can grow outward from its initial form and into something more complex and gratifying. The potential for animation as a medium is limited by the public's perception of it as suitable only as being for light sitcom, or something solely for children. We want to help change that.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samsweetmilk/sam-sweetmilk-animated-sci-fi-comedy?ref=discovery_category_newest,samsweetmilk/sam-sweetmilk-animated-sci-fi-comedy,"""Sam Sweetmilk is great!

While this project focuses more on jerky recipes - My other reward is just the basic instructions on HOW to make it.. I'll probably be including some recipes on there as well. If you just want the basic instructions on how to make it - pledge to my other project:www.kickstarter.com/projects/98632737/walk-me-homeThanks all for the support - this project is still active and will be completed in full if funded!I make my own Beef Jerky at home all the time. It's delicious, It's much less expensive than buying beef jerky at the store (most of what you're paying for is packaging, delivery, advertising, shelf space etc.) It keeps for a long time, It's good for you, It's got low/0 carb's (most recipes). It's awesome. I'm going to put all my best recipes together in a bookwith full instructions and pictures on how you can make it at home. HonestlyPeople should be eating a serving of beef jerky every day, it's an excellent source of protein, doesn't raise you're insulin level.. It's good for building muscle and losing fat - but not the kind you pick up at 7/11.. Some of the things I've found on the back of your standard ""beef jerky"" package:Making Jerky is easy, and it's also fun. After reading this book you'll be able/want to:Some of my awesome Jerky Flavors you'll be making in no time:",Not many risks involved..

I told him I wanted to move back to Massachusetts to be with my family and friends (I've been in Florida since 2010) and he asked when I'd be back.. I told him I put on some weight while my wife was pregnant and that I would stay focused and lose it first and then decide when.. He said ""Well, if you just walked from Florida to here you'd be skinny by the time you got here..."" and the idea was born. My wife and baby are going to Massachusetts to stay with my family; and Pat's going to fly back down to make the trek there with me. It's going to be awesome and terrifying.We're going to get GoPro Cameras and solar chargers to film as much as possible and make the whole thing into a movie.We're also going to write a book explaining how we did it, which routes we took - maps of things we found/places we stayed, Gear that we used, and gear we wish we had brought. We think the book is likely to give a little more insight to the physical and mental toll this journey will have on us. Some of it will be written on the road as a journal, some will be written reflectively once we arrive at our destination.We're going to use a sports tracker (as often as battery allows) that shows changes in elevation and the time it took - how fast we went and the exact routes we took..Our Goal is to leave by about the middle of March. No later than April 1st.A long distance/cross country hike is a common dream for a lot of people. With this project being funded we will be able to pass on the tools and knowledge to make it a possibility for others in the future. The final movie is going to be a nice blend of inspiration, comedy, and times of extreme hardship/deprivation. I hope that some of our backers have similar mindsets and are free to contact us for additional information about making a trip like this themselves. We'd like to map a great route and do this more than once - Maybe the next time we do it, we'll be leading an expedition!Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and we're truly grateful for your interest in our project and thanks for the donations that are going to help Walk Me Home.For any questions regarding this project I can be reached at WalkMeHome2015@Gmail.com, or through Kickstarter's message service.",The biggest risk is that we could both die..

A gasoline combustion engine with an efficiency range from 51% to 62% with it's peak power being produced 54% engine efficiency. This might mean something to you, very little or absolutely nothing, and that is alright. What is important and is simple that every can understand it, the more efficient an engine the best gas mileage you are going to get, generally speaking.Most engines under the hood of your car cannot crack 30% and get very bad gas mileage because of this. What I am asking money for, is a revolution in internal combustion engine design. This would mean that the car in your garage could get well over 100 mpg, and easily travel 2000 miles on a 15 gallon tank.My plan is not to try to compete with Ford, GM or Dodge in the car industry though. Going into business with any one of those companies would mean that I am trying to compete against all the rest, which could mean this technology doesn't get to market for 5, or 10 years. Maybe it never gets to market because it doesn't make financial sense for the purse string holders. I'm not about all that, and I am more interested in just finishing a consumer version that doesn't have a bunch of greed at the top holding science back.I want to address the environmental impact of my invention and how endorsing it could be seen as endorsing fossil fuel burning. One major impact of my design is that is because the engine is running as such a higher efficiency, it does not kick out carbon monoxide and other harmful contaminants that should NOT be there. Our engines do no properly and completely burn the gasoline, which my engine does. It is many magnitudes of order cleaner than any normal combustion engine, and if every engine out there were my design right now, the planet's plants would easily absorb the CO2 without seeing any major Climate Change. Changing to my design will be MUCH better for the environment than Electric Vehicles as well, until the planet has a clean way to produce and recycle all the toxins in the Lithium Ion batteries that cannot be overstated. In 10 to 20 years, when all those cars batteries need to be recycled, we are talking about a ecological disaster that if some other countries don't take and clean up our mess, we just might be living in a nightmare.","This project will not be fast.

She is joined there by her rebellious best friend Daisy who is like the complete opposite of Alegra.Alegra’s intelligence is already well known throughout the university and everyone is awaiting her arrival including 3 senior representatives who all want her to be their responsibility for the opening month.They are people who will look each form group of the students, the 3 after Alegra’s form group are Madison, Troy and Romeo.The lucky person is Madison who is captain of the cheerleading squad, she gets to look after Alegra’s group and manages to influence Alegra to tryout for the squad but Alegra is very doubtful on how controversial it could get.Madison witnesses an accident and when she tells Alegra about it after lunch, the new girl and title character admits to dreaming the exact incident the night before.Daisy feels this could be rather useful in the prospect of gaining popularity at the biggest state university but Alegra feels it was just a fluke and nothing worth exploring further.Daisy had just returned from Panama and missed Alegra’s birthday, this meant Alegra could spend more time planning her birthday party and she wants to make no exceptions and impress her new found friends.Daisy meets cute guy Nigel and they seem to get on like a house on fire but Daisy doesn’t want to jump into anything as she’s only been there 5 minutes.Troy and Romeo explain how Madison may look like a perfect role model but she is terrible at education and mainly focuses her efforts on sport.There is a debate on religion versus science and Alegra admits that the Discovery channel makes a lot of its history programmes up but Troy and Romeo say they find them useful.Alegra announced that she questioned Stephen Hawking about science’s lies but he sent her back a blank e-mail.Daisy is upset about how easily Madison gets her own way and tries to convince Nigel that her best friend should stay well clear of sport.Alegra announces to Madison that she never has seen a game of American football, Baseball or Basketball and prefers Show jumping or getting involved with animals.Daisy tries to get Alegra interested in Netball as she had a bit of talent in it in high school but Alegra has made her mind up that she is going to tryouts and make the cheerleading squad.Alegra announces that she was in the Miss Alabama’s outstanding teen pageant over the summer and Madison is surprised Alegra didn’t win.Troy and Romeo think Madison’s plans may be over the top but she’s made such successful students to do great things in the past so why should she loose her touch now.Alegra and Daisy visit the library and are allowed to take a book out, Alegra wants to learn more about cheerleading but when she sees a picture of a girl showing a midriff she realises there’s no way she can get round it and her deeply religious mother would never see a reason behind joining the squad.They plan a trip to the mall so they can get new outfits for Alegra’s birthday party and to give her a more grown-up approach from high schoolAlegra goes and asks her mothers permission in order to let Madison come to the ranch and teach her a routine that would get her through tryouts with no problem.Daisy talks on the bus about how difficult she’ll find that evening’s Horse riding activity but Alegra tells her that over time she will improve.Alegra announces that her mother is pleased she has a distraction from never seeing her father and Nigel gets invited to the upcoming party.If you want to vision what the main character resembles, think of a cross between Hailee Steinfeld, an environmentalist and a lot of knowledge like a super computer.","Of course the biggest challenge is finding a lead when the talent agent don't know if their talent wants to risk their time and energy

Sitting at the house listening to tons of music and watching The Godfather on repeat. lol. I thought of how I wanted to put this shirt together and how I wanted the sound to translate out of a phone, speakers, or headphones. The shirt will also allow you to share your music through blue tooth with other people or interact and play altogether as a band through the shirt. I found some old clothing laying around I got a few wires that I pulled out of old headphones and cords, grabbed my paint brush, a arduino board, and a speaker. I pushed the wiring thru the seams of the shirt, laid it down with two sheets of cloth, duct tape and fabric glue connected it to the paint and voila! The team now had a prototype.PROCESS VOL.2Once I got the prototype together we still had a few kinks to work out in our design because the shirt needed to be washable, upgraded in its sound output to go from an outside speaker to a bluetooth operated speaker, marketable, and most of all affordable. So in this process we created the customized hand painted designs to be a detachable patch that can be easily removed for washing. The lithium battery and arduino board, the two things that make the music operate would also detach from the shirt all in one. We also removed the thick wiring and replaced it with a much thinner conductive string. Oh yes and the last, but most important thing we had to do was cut down the cost. Using all the materials around the house plus buying a few things it took roughly $85.00 to make the shirt which means, uuuuh yeah pretty high retail prices. But have no fear kiddies The M5K team figured that out as well.PROCESS VOL.3So after quickly analyzing that the technical aspect of the shirt was our highest cost, we stepped outside of our circle and found higher connections. They not only had a way for us to make it cheaper, but they also could help us design our own board for a major fraction of the cost, and by major fraction let me help you get a understanding of that. If you were initially paying $60 for something and suddenly you could get it for $5 wouldn't you get it? Exactly. So we finalized our business plan, and crunched down a few numbers. Now we need your help to refine the product, do testing and analysis, marketing, and then finally spread the word and get us ready for the first step into manufacturing this on a larger scale so that you, yeah you! the consumer can create your own art, wear your own art, and express your art through Musick. Help Us Build This Musical Apparel We wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way to get this idea produced and into your hands.

For example, if a customer spent $30 at a restaurant the receipt would display, ""You've Earned $3 in Gourmetmiles, Scan Below!"" Gourmetmiles credit (miles) could then be used same as cash at the restaurants they were earned.While customers enjoyed this mildly successful app, it wasn't until later that we discovered we had something bigger.  Gourmetmiles didn't only track amount spent, but also what foods were ordered.We reached out to partner restaurants to discuss collecting detailed nutrition information for their menu items.  This data would be provided to customers in addition to loyalty incentives.  The idea was well received by partner restaurants, but was costly and needed work.With limited resources for loyalty app upgrades, we made the tough decision to pull Gourmetmiles from the app store to begin building a diet monitoring platform.  During the process we discovered other apps that tracked packaged foods (MyFitnessPal, FatSecret, etc.).  Many of these apps also tracked natural foods through a one-size-fits-all approach.  This means every apple has the same calories, sugars, etc. regardless of size and weight.We believed we could fix this and become the first platform to accurately track all three food sources.  With restaurant and packaged food tracking figured out, natural food tracking was the final challenge.Summer 2018 while tinkering with a new iPhone X, I noticed different prompts were displayed based on pressure applied to the touchscreen.  The idea for an iPhone food scale was born.Fast forward to now; what are our risks and challenges?The magnitude of being the first platform to accurately monitor complete diet using only a smartphone and a portable scale, we knew there'd be risks and challenges.  I'll list them below and address how we will overcome each.Partnerships:As with any new idea/company, it takes demand and growth to become significant enough to create partnerships with larger companies.  Gourmetmiles would benefit from partnerships not only with restaurants, but also with health and wellness apps/companies.  For example, a partnership with Fitbit would allow Gourmetmiles to not only monitor what you consume, but also what you burn.  Providing you with food intake as well as food burn analysis.  An integration partnership with 23andMe would allow Gourmetmiles to not only warn of restaurant foods you're allergic to, but also what menu items your body needs less or more of based on your specific DNA. We'll overcome this challenge by campaigns similar to this one.  Educating people of the importance of accurate diet monitoring and how Gourmetmiles achieves it will be crucial to growth as well as gaining the partnerships that take our technology even further.Technology:As mentioned above, how close our technology comes to reaching full potential is a risk.  What does this mean?  While we do have a funding goal for our Kickstarter campaign, that goal will only enable us to develop an app (& scales) that track diet from natural, packaged, and restaurant (partner locations) foods.  But we have even bigger things in mind. Every Kickstarter sale over our $35k goal helps improve the Gourmetmiles app to perform more advanced diet analysis functions.  For example, we want to bring dietitians, nutritionists, and medical doctors onboard to help develop algorithms based on factors of age, weight, race, gender, etc.  This will allow us to provide better dietary analysis based on your personal health status.We will overcome this risk similar to our partnerships challenge.  By educating on the importance of accurate diet monitoring.  With campaigns like this one and a little social media marketing, we believe Gourmetmiles and the Gourmetmeasure scale will change how we eat."

I Passionately believe in the Bucky O'Hare Characters, Story and Concept even if it failed and only lasted for such a short time. The Downfall of Bucky was due to the time this Animation / Comic / Video Game was released, it was right after teh die off of all the space and galaxy fad happening in the late 70s and 80s. When Bucky was released it was overlooked for that reason. Everyone just blew off the intergalactic green rabbit as just another space show!   True Bucky Lovers know better and find the true love and passion in the characters and story this wonderful show created. This is the reason I am here today ....to get BUCKY O'HARE : The Reboot. Live! I have a team of Animators lined up to assist us in this project butunfortunately they don't work for free. Now as for writers, there is/was aBucky O'Hare Web Series that was a fan project started by DJ Clawson in 1998. The series produced five complete seasons of Text Only Screenplays of Bucky O'Hare, continuing where the cartoon left off. We plan on using these continued Screen plays to keep the Series ALIVE. We may alter or manipulate the stories as needed but we have a solid 5 years worth of Bucky O'Hare Episodes. WE ALL COULD BE ENJOYING!  The Voices will be carefully picked and have hired voice talent similar to the original characters to keep it as true to the Original we all enjoy!The Stages of The one and Only ""Bucky O'Hare"".SketchesColor Examples",We know our challenge and  it's lack of funding. we have everything ready ... we just need you now!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/681857974/goobers-galaxy-childrens-educational-videos-that-g?ref=discovery_category_newest,681857974/goobers-galaxy-childrens-educational-videos-that-g,"      In this new era of Smartphones, Smart TVs and Tablets, Children are going to YouTube for more and more videos every day. The problem with this is the majority of videos for children on YouTube are not very educational or informative with High Quality learning Material that will prepare these little one for the Lessons and Standards in School Today!         Hopefully like us, you too love Children and seeing their eyes light up with excitement for something they love. That’s the gift we want to bring to them and to create Fun, Entertaining Quality Children’s Educational YouTube Videos to life that will not only educate young children but Help Children in a whole other way. Not only will we be creating quality Educational Content for children but we want to help other children as well specifically any child going through cancer, a child suffering with a heart problem or even a child with a rare disease.         If we can meet or exceed our goal to get all of the equipment and people we need to create a successful team, we’re going to donate a portion of all our Advertising revenue and merchandise sales made after this project to many different Childhood Cancer and Research Organizations every month. We want to be the Project that Donates with every view, not just once or twice but for the remainder of our existence! So, please help us educate the minds of our little ones while helping other have a fighting chance at life as well!       Kids love to watch YouTube videos. Parents love to see their children learn. Help us put the two together and what do we have? Children’s Educational YouTube Channel. Although all children will be able to view the Children’s Educational YouTube project, there are many children who especially need the programming we will produce together. From red and yellow, black and white to everything in sight we will go over the rainbow of colors to give vibrancy to the life of kids. That sounds obvious and simple but we are going to do it in a unique, fun and powerful way. Kids will learn their shapes, sounds, numbers, the ABC’s and much more. They will take a view into science or listen as our puppets read amazing stories. Right from Goober’s Galaxy to your favorite device! This outstanding Children’s Education YouTube Channel is going to be equipped to help all children learn and enhance education on a personal level. Kids need the best education and we want to be a great enhancement and strong resource for homeschoolers, tutors, and teachers and beyond. Pre-K and Kindergarten educators will deeply benefit from having Goober's Galaxy right in their classroom. School children will be wowed by our programming. It is only going to be made possible by supporters like yourself. Parents wanting the best lessons to be taught will find us as the place to go for their little learners. Imagine helping a child unable to attend school because he or she is home sick or in the hospital. We don’t want that child left behind. Actually, we want them to have fun getting ahead. Our whole aim is to better the minds of little learners who may or may not be at a disadvantage. Sure many kids have cable programming but it’s nothing like what we are proposing – a unique and fun Children’s Educational channel on YouTube that can be taken with and viewed on any device. We will be accessible to the entire world of children. Leaving the USA, we will reach Europe, South Africa, Japan, India and in fact the whole English-speaking world. Those learning English will benefit too. Education is to be enjoyable. Our children will sing the ABC’s along with us and learn how to make out letter shapes. We will take them into the depths of science. Imagine taking a trip to Mars right from the Goober’s Galaxy YouTube channel. We will engross children with exciting adventures. Astronauts float in space while puppets tell the story of the first moon landing. Alphabet letters zoom through the sky while stories are told with each letter as it lands on the earth. As Circles, triangles and numbers rumble into view, each is described and counted by teaching creatures in the cast.  Producing a YouTube channel of this magnitude costs more than we have to begin production and maintain operation. We need current professional gear & technology to do this awesome work. To make this production possible it will take having the right equipment. A professional video camera will enable us to make a polished movie quality presence for the Children’s Educational YouTube channel. We want children to learn well and our cast will want to look their best. To this end we also need the correct studio lighting and audio equipment. For the magnitude of teaching we’re going to give those special little ones we need to sound right and look terrific. Additionally, we need a green screen with production software and a powerful PC to process those videos. Employees are skilled professionals. We need financial resources to pay them for an animator and video editor. Puppet upgrades are needed to remain current with the industry. They need to be updated and replaced along with new props as needed in the future. This industry is constantly evolving and we want to keep abreast of the times. Taking this journey with us will be the investment of dreamers. Your considerate contribution with us will not go unnoticed. Your investing contribution will go a long way in helping Goober’s Galaxy get off the ground and running. Without investors it simply won’t happen. The more you’re willing to share, the further our project will go to teach little learners, getting edifying results from our special YouTube channel. We have written excellent material. It’s ready to be produced. Goober’s Galaxy simply needs the equipment and cast to put it into motion. The hard part is done. Now for the challenge of finding a compassionate heart who loves children as much as we do we need help getting started. Your investment will have a great impact on suffering children as well as the general public. With your financial support we will be involved with kids who will explore the universe of learning. With your helpful funds we can watch families explore the wonderful opportunities afforded by Goober’s Galaxy. We will let neither our children nor you down.","Our project is Set and Ready to go if we can meet our goals, We have Our Puppet Characters and Cartoon designs prepared. We have a talented graphic designer and some contributors willing to help us prepare and make more puppets as needed.The biggest challenge we will have is getting our videos seen and  recognized on YouTube to start while confident our videos will get recognized and seen organically we also will prepare an Ad campaign to help boost our start!"

The Dak is Back tour will visit every corner of the UK. Battlefield sightseeing trips over Normandy and Arnhem PLUS formation experiences with a SPITFIRE and HURRICANE! These flights will honour the crews of RAF TRANSPORT COMMAND, ensuring these unsung heroes are squarely in the public eye.David Lord VCDuring Operation Market Garden RAF Transport Command won it's only Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry. Flight Lieutenant David Lord won the award for a supply drop. Having dropped his supplies on the Drop Zone (DZ) under heavy anti aircraft fire, Lord was told there were still supplies onboard. With his left wing and engine ablaze, he elected to return to the DZ and deliver the desperately needed supplies. Shortly after the second drop the crippled Dakota could give no more, crashing with all onboard. Only the Navigator survived.RAF Transport Command served in every theatre of WW2, dropping paratroops and supplies in Europe, single handedly supplying cut off troops in India & Burma, supplying troops in Africa and most importantly for the airline industry, route finding for Atlantic crossings. This paved the way civilian transatlantic flights we take for granted today.OUR DAKOTA KG651 (G-AMHJ)In March 2014, RAF Transport Command Memorial took delivery of KG651 and now we will return this graceful aircraft to the skies!History:Built in Oklahoma City USA, allocated manufacturers serial number 13468 - 30th May 1944.•Delivered to the US Army Air Force on 30th May 1944 as 42-108962•Diverted to the Lend-Lease Programme as RAF Registration KG651 in Montreal - 03 Jun 1944•Arrived in UK - 13 Jun 1944•Delivered to 109 Operational Training Unit (OTU) Crosby in Eden, Cumberland - 26 Aug 1944•24 Sqn Hendon (Now the site of the RAF Museum) - 29 Aug 1945•1383 Transport Conversion Unit (T)CU Crosby in Eden - Mar 1946•1333 Transport Support Conversion Unit (TS)CU Leicester East - 23 Jul 1946•Surplus to requirements, into storage with 22 Maintenance Unit (MU) Silloth, Cumberland - 1 Oct 1946•Sold by the RAF to Air Prospectors - 21 Nov 1946Post war our Dakota began it's civilian career which saw it serve in Africa, the Middle East, Jersey and England. By 1987 it had joined Air Atlantique at Coventry where it served as a pollution control aircraft. In 2000 it was retired and moved to the Assult Glider Trust as a static display aircraft.Help us achieve our aims. Once airworthy, we will provide passenger flight experiences in our Dakota, including flights alongside famous WW2 aircraft!For more information visit our website www.raftransportcommandmemorial.com","The restoration of KG651 will be undertaken by a dedicated team of vintage aircraft engineers, strictly supervised by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Given it's history, KG651 is in very good condition, needing very little work, just 2 new engines are required, the rest of the aircraft is a simple inspect and repair. Challenges to getting the aircraft certified for passenger work are being worked on, the CAA being very helpful. Once the post restoration flight takes place we will complete the paperwork for our Air Operators Certificate. Naturally, aviation encounters delays. Any supporters electing for a flight package will receive their flight as soon as the paperwork is in place.Our team is very experienced in the world of classic aviation and airline travel.

La arqueobotánica nos ayudará a llenar vacíos de información no disponibles en los textos epigráficos e iconográficos, y de esta manera conciliar la evidencia arqueológica, con los resultados de los análisis pertinentes, y ofrecer nuevos aportes al entendimiento de la subsistencia de un grupo arquitectónico prehispánico maya y su lugar dentro del entramado político y social de la antigua ciudad de Palenque.English.The present research proposal will perform a multiproxy analysis, in order to identify different plant species (plants, seeds, fruits, wood, etc.) that were available to the dwellers of a residential complex in the ancient Maya city of Palenque. This research will allow the reconstruction of the entire sum of plant species, wood and foods used in the subsistence of the members of this household unit, from the Preclassic to Late Classic periods (250 BC-900 AD).  My research will explore the degree to which the occupants of this residential compound manipulated the natural setting, and the activities linked to obtain food, the data obtained, also provide us with information on the organization of food production, possible tilling of fields, crops, cooking of food processing, medicinal uses, utilitarian use of wood and with the appropriate archaeological evidence, indicators of health derived from the diet consumed.  This will be an interdisciplinary project and with the aid of the Archaeobotany, Carpology,Anthracology, Biology and Bioarchaeology, it will be possible to answer important questions about the daily life of the inhabitants of this residential unit at the classic Maya center of Palenque ","Desde mi Licenciatura, he estado involucrado en proyectos de recorrido, excavación y registro de materiales en Palenque, mi tesis de licenciatura, giró sobre el origen, crecimiento y la urbanización del sitio antiguo, desde el Preclásico hasta el abandono en el clásico tardío y por dos años que estuve excavando en todo el sitio. Por lo que ahora, mi principal interés para mi tesis doctoral, está relacionado con la subsistencia y la explotación del ambiente local en un complejo residencial del sitio; éste conjunto, encontramos toda la secuencia de ocupación a lo largo de la existencia de Palenque. Tengo una experiencia importante de excavación, análisis de cerámica, no solo en Palenque, si no en varias regiones de Mesoamerica. He asistido como ponente de al menos 5 Congresos, y tengo 11 publicaciones, acerca de mi trabajo en Palenque y una publicación en inglés. Trabajé en el INAH por alrededor de 10 años, en varias categorías como investigador, así como jefe de departamento, conociendo y obteniendo toda la experiencia necesaria para la realización de proyectos de investigación. Por lo que no existe ningún obstáculo o riesgo, que ponga en peligro la realización del proyecto arqueológico.EnglishSince my BA degree, I was involucrated with excavations at the Maya center of Palenque, my BA Dissertation was about the origin,urbanization and growth of the ancient site, since the Preclassic up to the abandonment in Late Classic times,and for two years i was excavating in the whole site, so my main interest now in my Ph. D dissertation its related with the subsistence and exploitation of the local environment in one residential complex of the site, in which area we found the whole sequence of occupation along the existence of Palenque. I have an important experience excavating, analyzing ceramics and working not only in Palenque, but in a at least five important projects all across Mesaomerica, i attended at least 5 conferences, and I have 11 publications, about my work in Palenque, and 1 of the publications it’s in English “Space and Population in Palenque at the End of the Late Classic”, I have one accepted publication and one more it’s still under review, both to be published next year. During my formation in the Ph. D program at my university, I was attending different classes that prepares me to affront my investigation, that includes several courses at the Biology Faculty, in order to have the knowledge about the recognition of several forms of flora present at the ancient site, the courses include “Vegetal Anatomy and its applications in Archaeobotany”, “Botanical Forestry” ""Bioindicators” and “History of the domestication of plants in Mesoamerica”; as an important part of the internationalization of my University and central part of my Ph.

How vulnerable is Europe to climate change? Climate change is impacting and will continue to impact the European continent. Climate impacts vary across Europe. This project wants to explore cities and wildlife vulnerability, and its human adaptation. Approach is optimist and energetic: we have problems, but also solutions.  For this reason I will try to relate a positive story. Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.Adaptation strategies are needed at all levels of administration: at the local, regional, national, EU and also the international level. Due to the varying severity and nature of climate impacts between regions in Europe, it's much-needed ability to cope and adapt differs across populations, economic sectors and regions within Europe.According toEuropean Environment Agency cities in northern and western Europe can expect more heatwave days in the future while several cities are projecting green areas to allow citizens easy access to cooler open space. On the other hand there are whole European mountain glaciers that are melting. ThePhotographic Reportage Book wants to witness the state of affairs and the adaptation cases in Europe, through a photographic journey.The planned trip will start from Switzerland than Italy, the Alps and the city of Sassari. Spain in the city of Badajoz. Porto in Portugal. Norway, NL, Germany and UK where it will be attested all the innovative human activity to adapt to climate change. Ending with Hungary and Poland to record the changes in agriculture.The book will be made of 124 color pages, 21x30cm, printed in full color.Where the Money GoesThe total project cost is approximately € 19,100. Part of the expenditure, about € 8,000, should be covered by the pre-sales and cash, the remaining 11,100 I'm looking for funding offline, but if I can raise the money on Kickstarter I would avoid lengthy courtship and negotiations.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smango/shareberry?ref=discovery_category_newest,smango/shareberry,"Introduction:Hi, my name is Soki Membere-Otaji and I am an MBA student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am currently working on an app that enables users to share their phone battery charges with other users via Bluetooth.Inception:I got the idea for the app while I was at a mall with my brother and my mum. we had just arrived at the mall, and I was low on battery because I used the GPS on my phone to get us there. I needed to find away to get my phone charged to a point that would enable me to use the GPS on the way home. While texting my brother, because he had wandered of, to ask for a USB , I got the idea. Wouldn't it be nice if you could get anyone close by, who had the same mobile device you did , to share some of his or her battery charges with you wirelessly in seconds. The whole point is not to replace the charger, but rather to help people stay charged in order complete important tasks on their mobile devices, until they can get chargers.Before I go into more detail about the project, I need to share the story of how I got started in technology in the first place. Four years ago, I was at an event in a church; and at this event there was a prophetic session. During the prophetic session people from the church staff, who could hear from God, stood in a line and spoke prophetic words to anyone that approached them. When it came to my turn to receive a prophetic word , a man whom I had never met in my life told me that God would give me breakthrough ideas in the area of technology.He didn't say it out loud, and so no body else but me heard it. I thought God probably had the wrong person because at that point in time I had no interest whatsoever in technology. Still going through the line ,a lady gives me the same prophetic word that was given to me earlier:"" God would give me breakthrough ideas in technology"". One could say the lady probably overheard the man, but I guarantee you that wasn't the case because they were not in close proximity to each other, and there was also music playing in the background. At that point I believed the prophetic word. There was no way those two people could tell me the same thing unless it came from God. A few months after those encounters , I got the the idea for shareberry.Development:Currently, I have finished developing the basic version of the app for android devices. I believe the technology will work because I know God gave me the idea for the application; and also gave me the wisdom and grace to complete it. There was no way I would have been able to get this project started, let alone complete it without His help. There were many times ,while working on the project, where I literally had no clue what to do. In those moments I prayed to God for help, and a few moments later I got answers.I ran the code on my computer, and there are no bugs. However, I need to test the app on real devices, which brings me to why I need to raise funds. I need to buy two android devices in order to test out the technology. I also need to buy a mac book in order to develop the iOS version, and also buy two iPhones for testing. The rest of the funds would go to supporting the back end of the app for both operating systems on firebase and miscellaneous .Budget:The budget estimated for the project is $8710. Here's the breakdown :Timeline:Assuming I am able to raise the funds quickly,The android app should be ready for beta testing by December. While beta testing is underway, I will start developing the iOS version. Beta testing for the iOS app would start in February of 2019, and the app will launch officially in March 2019.By the grace of God, I plan on creating a startup out of this app; and so I believe the funds would be enough until I'm able to raise a seed round from a Venture Capital.Rewards:It has been a journey developing shareberry, and I would like to bring my backers along for the ride.For a pledge of $15 or more, backers would be able to take part in beta testing the app before its official launch. Have any questions or suggestions concerning the project email me at sdmembere@gmail.com.Thanks for your support,Soki.","The challenge that could arise is the delay in rewards for the backers.  Before opening up the app for beta testing, alpha testing needs to be done to make sure the app functions properly. This may take longer than expected, assuming I need to change some back-end code. This is why I scheduled the official launch for March of 2019, to ensure the app works fine; and by the grace of God it will.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smango/ar-messaging-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,smango/ar-messaging-app,"Smango is a messaging application that enables users to send messages, which trigger animations , enabling users to share expressions that are fun and exciting in real time.screen shots with messaging & animations:The video demo shows messaging between to users in real time. The animations are not augmented reality (AR) images due to the time it would take for the users to position their smartphones, and time lag for the AR images to appear. However, we put the messaging activity and animations on the AR camera background because new features that will be introduced on the app will be in augmented reality.I'd like to use the kickstarter campaign to raise the $35,000 needed to support the app/startup ,and also get early users.Breakdown:Pledge $15 or more : Get early access to the application after official launch on the App Store and Google play.Pledge $20 or more: Get a chance to beta test the app , as well as early access to official launch.Due to the fact that augmented reality is still a relatively new technology, Smango may not function properly on older mobile devices.iOS: functional on iPhone 6s - 11Android: Please click here to see all compatible android devices.Thanks for taking the time to learn about the project. I hope you consider pledging to support it.",Potential risks might be the need to push the beta testing and  launch date to a later date.

We will work on helping to provide wholesale goods to various manufacturers and distributors to sell our international franchise foods through our company’s creative approach to the company’s image and detail presentation. Adun will provide a combination of excellent food at value pricing, with fun packaging and labeling to attract consumers. Adun’s food products will be the answer to an increased demand of better manufactured West African/Nigerian goods in the American diaspora and a new option to Nigerian dinning the surrounding DC/DMV area. Adun is a locally owned food business that has a focus and position to serve as an international ambassador of Nigerian food. With the highly competitive food business environment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate various food businesses from each other. Due to Adun’s unique platform and menu ideas, it will be a model for West African cuisine and Nigerian food for the District of Columbia and it will be a great model for development in the surrounding DC area. Our industry is a food business. We see changes as we grow as a food business. In short term, we see changes going from a start-up industry to a fully-operated company that is taking many more large, lump sum of orders on a daily basis. Long-term we see changes as we grow towards becoming a fully-operated restaurant and dealing with logistics of restaurant operations and food company operations. Our company is prepared and poised to take advantage of them through our dedicated team who is driven to help this company grow and through the help of our food incubator-Union Kitchen as a resource for growth for our new food business.A Kickstarter loan wil help us grow our business and allow our net-capital to have some great leverage. We plan on spending the Kickstarter loan money on helping support our business in the beginning phases. It will be able to allow us to start buying equipment and hiring employees so we can begin expansion of our food business from a start-up licensed caterer to a full-time restaurant. Also, we will be able to have increased revenue and profit because with a Kiva loan we can buy more supples and have the financial stability we need to make a difference in the food atmosphere in the DC area. The business will be positively impacted by this loan as it will give us a chance to reach our longterm goal and mission while giving back to the customers through showcasing Nigerian food. It will also help provide increased diverse options of ethnic cuisine in various American cities which will help and aid with improved international relations in the diaspora. This loan will impact my own personal life so I do not have to go into debt for this business as well as give me the ability to fulfill my dream for my grandmother and it will help showcase the strife and challenges still faced today in my home country of Nigeria. This loan will greatly impact my life as I will be able to accomplish my life goals and missions to become a fully-fledged fast-casual restaurant which will give me great satisfaction. I will also be able to showcase the great wisdom and lessons learned from my grandmother and showcase her cooking knowledge to the greater American diaspora. Lastly, I will be able to showcase Nigeria in a positive light; therefore hopefully improving the international spotlight of my country.","The concept of a fast-casual Nigerian restaurant incorporates a lifetime of testing culinary ideas and a lot of planning in trying to launch this future goal. With help of donations and funding through Kickstarter, Adun can become a restaurant and pave the way for the future of Nigerian cuisine to preserve and showcase the foods of our culture to other various ethnic and cultural groups. With anything in life, risk and challenges are inevitable, but with my strong passion and dream to have this a reality, I am ready to face all challenges and risk which may come my way. Due to the fact that the food-business is a challenging enterprise it is clear that this in-itself can pose challenges and risks however, it is clear that the demand for a fast-casual Afro-inspired eatery  is high and that with my deeper passion of this food business, I will be able to ensure that we will have a successful business platform which will always allow our marketplace to flourish and grow.  Through the help of Union Kitchen, a food incubator in DC, and the DC Small Business Association as well as other investors and food marketing companies, we have been able to expand on profitable catering, pop-up, and market vending events. However, we are hoping that with your support through Kickstarter, we can reach our full potential which is expanding Adun into a fully-functional restaurant. We hope that our Kickstarter fundraising will be successful in raising the minimum amount needed to open this restaurant, and if we raise more than expected, above our goal, we will have the opportunity to further our impact on culture and food and improve the restaurant space. Food is vital in every culture as it is a way of life and it connects all unique cultures together.  The foods in the Nigerian culture is an innovative food concept which is worth investing in for the current and future generation.

Unfortunately, there is a huge lack of Nigerian food in the DMV areas, thus, Adun's Food Truck will be a huge impact in expanding Nigerian cuisine in the DMV. The funding amount requested in the campaign will be needed to purchase a Food Truck for my business. The funding will also be used to order necessary materials and equipment which are needed to initiate food truck operations. The unique aspect of this Food Truck is that there is a lack of Nigerian food in the DMV area; thus, a food truck will enable me to share my cuisine with others.","There might be some challenges in spreading the knowledge about Nigerian food; however, I will do my best to expand my networks in order to achieve as much funding as possible for the expansion into  a Food Truck .

This is a true story that took place in Decatur, Alabama in May of 1967 when Mary Faye went missing. Her remains were found by two children 5 months later. For 50 years her murder went unsolved, until now. Motivated by my grade school friend, Brad Golson, I decided to write a screenplay about this and he launched his own investigation into her death around December 2017. Since then, not only have we solved the case beyond a reasonable doubt, but we have uncovered a local conspiracy to conceal the truth about her death and those surrounding it. Also I have been motivated to return to film-making. When I was a teen my father, Dr. James W. Hunter produced two movies for me. The movies are available to watch for free on youtube.com/jwhiiiproductions. I have been working in film for almost 30 years. You see, Mary Faye was also my dad's sister. Please help us bring justice to Mary Faye by getting this film produced. Our hope is that through this film, we may spark renewed interest locally that might put pressure on the local government to close her case once and for all and give this closure. The local D.A. has refused to release any information to me, her only living relative interested in the case. They are withholding the autopsy report. They have shown no interest in our new evidence. You are not only producing a good quality film here, but you are also demanding justice with your support.This film will be a period piece, set in the early stages of Mary Faye Hunter's life beginning in 1954. The film with span the two decades preceding her murder, and will also follow her brother Jimmy's life. Our goal is to create an immersive experience to transport audiences back to the past, in search of the truth. The film will be a love letter to the 50's and 60's, and we plan on paying attention to every detail in order to keep the movie authentic to the period. Our youtube page will tell you more about us. Depending on our budget and needs, I plan to shoot the film digitally with possibly some 16mm and 8mm footage thrown in for authenticity. I will be able to pool my old resources in order to keep costs down and work faster. We expect a 30 - 60 day shoot with locations in Alabama and Tennessee. Possibly Georgia and California also. I would like Julia Garner (Ruth from Ozark) to play Mary Faye due to their uncanny resemblance. I am currently in negotiations with her representatives. I am very serious about this project.If you have any other questions or concerns, please contact us at 3412timberway@gmail.com for more information. Please share this Kickstarter page as much as possible. Thanks so much.","I am the type of filmmaker that likes to work with the same people. So it will be cost efficient in that respect. However, ""Beyond The River Bridge"" is a period film set in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's. So the set decoration and costumes must reflect those time periods. This can become costly.

And it does so with some of the most beautiful sunny countryside in the world. It is a summer vacation in itself.  You can go from the beach in Jacksonville, FL. to the beach in Santa Monica, CA. on I-10, with only about 1 and 1/2 mile from beach to I-10.   We propose to travel I-10 and show you the best and worst of what the New Route 66, I-10, has to offer. FORMAT OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO: First we will set up my truck with an overhead rack that has a live four direction camera viewer. The truck will have, on truck satellite dishes for 24 hour video feed for a website documenting the trip (During the I-10 trip only). The web site will be a paid for viewing website.There will be an inside camera, microphone and computer for in route commentary on what we see and how fun we think it is. Also for live input from viewers.We will buy a couple of hand held cameras to do, away from the truck reviews of parks, recreational stops, restraunts, fuel stops and rest areas along the way.We will hire a computer technician to set up a live feed from the truck to a home location for the web site and participate as a commentator during the trip.Set for 7:00 AM the first day of summer 2015 (June 21), we plan to leave from the beach at Jacksonville, FL. Get on I-10 and make a stop about every 40 to 50 miles or so to evaluate the services for travelers. (This is specifically for people traveling, so we plan to search each area within a 10 mile area of that 40 to 50 mile distance for a good, safe place to stop.)We plan on going from about 50 to 75 miles off the path for special locations of vacationing environment and enjoyment.   Then at the end we will pull off the I-10 and onto the Santa Monica pier to end the trip.All total we expect the trip to take a little over a month to complete. The trip will be offered “Live” via the website on the computer. At the moment we are going to ask set amounts of payment for live viewing of; one day of viewing, one week of viewing and the whole trip, each a different amount. After the trip is over we will make the entire trip available to the internet audience for a one time flat fee to down load or just watch whenever they want. We will have live morning evaluations and ratings, (Set tentatively at 7:00 AM every morning.)We will have permanent postings of all evaluations.We will have the live and posted Highway interchange route directions. (As they get more difficult every year and are difficult to decipher lane changes as you drive sometimes.)We will have live suggestions and conversations from video viewers on where to go and review. We will even buy things for certain lucky viewers. They will have to pay the cost and freight of the item bought, but we will mail it to them live. (That will be based on who is on line with us at the time.)We will give out the prices of food, fuel, hotel rooms, services and price of admissions to all places who charge.We will evaluate on taste of food, cleanliness of restrooms and hotel rooms and fun of location.  The goal is to give travelers a heads up in a way that surpasses all maps, but does not replace the use of them completely. (NEW MAPS, are always a good idea when traveling.) We are also tentatively planing a 4th of July get together at Galveston beach to be broadcast on the site.","The website we will use.    America’s Gold Coast?They are everywhere!!!!  The website: this is the website tentatively titled;     “America’s Gold coast?. They are everywhere.” The plan is to start with a trip to the Arkansas crater of Diamonds, (See the kickstarter ""Arkansas Crater of Diamonds,"" project.) giving an in depth review of services and how to dig and find diamonds.Then on to the “Route 10, the new Route 66,” series start.There are many sites in America where a senior retired citizen with a small budget can go to have fun and maybe find a small fortune. From Emerald Mining in the Carolinas to Gold in remote canyons of Colorado and California to diamonds in Arkansas. Chances are you will not become rich but you could very well pay for your trip and not have to pay a guide. Although a guided program is always a good idea.The plan is to take the funds for the program and roll them into a permanent website where someone can go and for a few dollars sign up and learn where a good family place is to vacation and maybe find a fantastic conversation piece that will be with them for years to come.  And once the site is up and running, the plan is to add as many locations as we can over the next few years.

Millions of lonely people, who have in friends also lonely people, sitting in the expectation that somebody will write them a meaningless and standard message, such as ""hello"", ""how are you?"" etc. Millions of people, even with a strong desire cannot find a soul mate, or the people with whom they will be really interesting to spend time. Millions of people spend their lives in vain - they do not meet with friends at various events, they do not go hiking on nature, they are every day more and more lose interest in life, all the time they are waiting for these senseless messages. They have forgotten how it is - to breathe life deeply! Mobile social platform BIMP intended to change the current situation. BIMP with a probability of 99.99% will help you find the truly helpful people who will have the same interests, preferences and interests that have you. With the same probability BIMP will help you regain a taste for life, for this you need all only participate in the ""Adventures"" which will created by you or someone else. BIMP also will help you add to your life an intimate relationship if you need it. The main objective of our free platform - to be useful to people in almost all spheres of life, when people want to find new friends, new relationships (in all senses), new entertainments and new experiences in life. We have everything for that and you just need to use it! We position our app as the world's first social net where you can find people with whom you really will be interesting, but not with those who just ""hangs"" in your friends and you never spoke with them. You will be interested with such people in every sense: if you want to find romantic relationships, find an intimate relationship, find a friend. The search, only those people with whom you will be really interesting, is possible thanks to a unique system of Interests, ratings and invitations. Of even more unique features we offer make friendship in the car (service for travelers, which also has a unique system of interest); make friendship during the lunch (service of sharing your diner-time with others interesting people) and so-called ""adventures"" in which you can create any kind of event, which borders are limited only by your imagination. People who will use BIMP will not just ""sit"" in a social network and just waste their time, but they will be able to spend time with really interesting people and interesting events. BIMP is a platform, which insists that people will meet in real life, and not spend a long time of pointless correspondence. So the service will give you different opportunities as quickly as possible invite the person who you liked to the meeting. Also, BIMP will give the opportunity to earn money to people who organize adventures and also for motorists by the inviting people who want go with them along the way. System of reviews and recommendations will track the most active users, which will recommend others users to their services. All this is accompanied by standard features of communication such as: messages (classical, audio, video), invites, sympathy etc, and non-standard such as function of augmented reality. Turn on your camera and you will find out who is close to you wants to meet and spend time wondering.More about the categories of the application:1.	Search of love relationship.Imagine that you want to find the perfect mate. You enter your interests and preferences. BIMP automatically selects you to people with similar interests. You can put the ratio (in percent) on how those interests may be different from yours interests and preferences. As a general rule, it is very difficult to find someone with absolutely identical to the interests because each person is different, but if your interests coincide on 80% or more, then it is very good result. Then you are sharing sympathies (two options - open and anonymous) and after that, in case if you both will have mutual sympathies, you will have an opportunity to write each other. If your correspondence does not end after the first several messages, you will be able to send an invitation to the park, movie, restaurant, club and other public places. On the map you can choose where you want invite a person, and if this place means outlay - you will receive an exclusive discount in this institution from the BIMP. We are interested that people will meet. 2.	Search for friendsHere is clear. Again, there are your interests and interests of a person who you want to find to be your friend. Depending on these interests also will be formed a list of those places where you can go there to know each other better, talk about same topics. Here will also be available discounts (in, for example, different sports clubs and other places, with exclusive discounts from BIMP). Also, friends can recommend to you people from other categories, if you indicated that you are looking for. For example, you are looking for love and your friend will be able to offer his friend as an option and, in case of success, if you confirm that you have went out on a date with his familiar friend, it will give a positive rating to your friend and you which in the future will give you more benefits than people who have no this rating.3.	Search for an intimate relationshipHere also it's simple. You have interests, preferences and taboos. The system will provide you with the candidates with similar interests, preferences and taboos. Exchange of sympathies, messages, invites, meeting. It's simple as double-or two. Detailed describe of this function is meaningless; it must be seen and used! We guarantee that once you try - you will try many more times in the future!4.	Search for fellow travelersDrivers can leave a request with information of destination point and time of travel as well as the wishes of (the choice of the interests) about what he prefers to talk. Thus driver can make new friends and have fun with them. Request may be either paid to compensate some part of fuel, or free, that will increase the rating of the driver in several times more than the request which is surcharge. People, who want to find the driver, also need to send a request with the information about the trip and the priority interests. The system will select and display the necessary drivers. It's simple, understandable and interesting.5.	Interlocutors (companions) for lunch (for diner time)Quite a new trend in dating. Usually means not romantic or intimate acquaintances, but it is not excluded. Around the world, hundreds thousands of people have breakfast, lunch and dinner in alone with themselves. So BIMP comes to aid to these people. By leaving a request that you intend to go somewhere to dinner, you consent to the fact that you allow to join one or more people with whom you can start a conversation on topics that you are interested in. For now, this method of dating (meeting) the average user might seem a little strange, but we strongly sure that it is not stranger than such pointless correspondence or leaving meaningless comments in popular social networks. Here everyone can find a person, with who he might be dreaming to meet. For example, startups seeking an investor can send request to dinner with the theme of ""Business / Investment"" and find someone who can help him by providing his resources or can prompt such people, who can help. Weightlifter will be able to find people who can prompt some sports diet which can help to do the perfect body or a young mother can find more experienced mothers who can give advice in the child's upbringing. And all this will happen not by the help of senseless correspondence, and in real life. You must just to let such people entered into your life. Opportunities are everywhere!6.	Finally, the search for adventureOne of the most interesting, in our opinion, categories. On planet Earth, today the number of people is a little more than 7.3 billion people. According to scientists, the average quantity of happy people to the general population entire Earth is 23.9%, and every day, in the era of globalization, monopolization, propagation of corporations, increasing the number of poor people on the planet, etc., this percentage is becoming smaller. Let's face it - people have forgotten how to live. It is understood that the vast majority of people now do not need anything except a computer or phone with wifi and reading USELESS, spending all your energy and makes you think that you live a little bit better than others, NEWS and, of course, free porn (which with the sum of news websites is more than 70% (!!!) of all sites on the Internet). People forgot how to enjoy every moment, every minute, every second that we live right now. BIMP is eager to help you solve this problem. If BIMP will make that at least 0.1% of the people will live happier and will begin appreciate every moment, then it will be a victory. The point is this: in life you are an active person, all the time you cannot wait to make new friends, somewhere to walk, to attend all kinds of interesting activities, create flash mobs, etc - you are the person we are looking for. It is through you and your imagination you can realize our dream to make people happier. Create an adventure: it can be a hike in the mountains or to the lake for a picnic with games in the woods or the sea, it can be a collective meeting for the game of football, basketball and other sports; it can be a hike to a night club or a bowling club; all kinds of games, hike to cinemas, followed by discussion in a cafe, flash mobs, parties, group dinners, skydiving, hiking to gyms and lots more. You are limited only by your imagination. Requests may be both paid (for example, to participate in a private party, and so on), as well as free, which, as in the case of fellow travelers, will raise your ranking of creator of ""adventures"" many times more than the paid requests. If you are a very ordinary person how other millions on the planet who like and want to change something in his life, but still, or is afraid of something, or waiting for the right moment, or wants to change everything for the better next Monday, you can open offers of other people. You just have to send the application for participation and in the very near future you will be able to do something that you feared or did not dare to do; At one's ease and with the fun you can make new friends and acquaintances; You can finally appreciate life and enjoy every moment of it! You also can send the request of what things you would like to do, and the system will direct you to the right candidate, who has created the same, or similar, event.Once you do - you risk losing something; you do not do ever - you risk never know what you could find something!BIMP - Appreciate every moment!--------------- Information about rewards ---------------Pledge €1Thank you, friend!

The information below can permanently disrupt your understanding of cycling. If you'll participate in Framler, your life will be separated on ""BEFORE"" and ""AFTER""it. If you do not want to change something in your usual bike rides - please close this page! Everyone else - let's start!Framler is an application for Android / iOs designed to unite all cyclists in the world and find out what is your place among all of them online at a specific point in time. Framler has completely new and unique features that are not found anywhere else.My name is ILYA. My homeland is Ukraine, but for a long time I live in France and here is my second home. I love to ride a bike. Over the years of my stay here, I noticed that here, as in many other countries, cycling is very developed. Both in amateur and professional form. In neighboring countries, cycling is even more developed. For example in Netherlands, the world leader of cycling, 99.1% from all population are cyclists. More and more people in the world realize the benefits of bicycles and every day more people are starting to ride. And this tendency grows up from year to year.There are over a billion bicycles worldwide, although they are used in different ways: 70% of all bicycles are used as a means of transportation, 29% are used for recreation and only 1% for sports. By the statistic every seventh inhabitant of the planet - a cyclist.While riding a bicycle, the thought occurred to me: every day, millions of people use a bicycle. It would be great to combine everyone in one open world championship and determine the best among them. But how can this be done? Then I decided to create Framler.Unification of all the world's cyclists in a place where they can not only play sports and communicate (which is already realized in many applications), but also play, combining real sport and virtual reality, develop their character (avatar), beat each other in the championships (and in PvP racings) and receive real bonuses. Here everyone, if desired, will be able to feel like a star of cycling.Being a designer, I drew the first layout. In the first version, Framler combined the features of a classic fitness tracker (similar to what the well-known ""Strava"" offers), a game (leveling the character with the ability to activate multiple bonuses) and four types of championships (city, regional, national, international). That was almost two years ago. Here are some graphics:Yes. My personal savings were enough to develop the registration page, the main page, the race page, statistics after the race / overall statistics and the championships page. And just recently, the first work on introducing augmented reality began. But this job needs a completely different budget.Actually, no. Now the SQL base does not work. It needs to be rewritten. The previous base had many bugs in optimization.Over time, design and form of Framler evolved.Today, Framler offers not only the championships with all popular tracker's features and basic game's elements (with almost completely revised and redesigned friendly & intuitive interface), but with the addition of several really unique high-tech gaming functions:1. Pvp competition in which you can see the 3D shadow of your opponent, who rode earlier along the same path.2. Collecting the bonuses (gains) through your phone's camera (augmented reality)3. An advanced character (avatar) game interface where you need to collect equipment that gives extra points to the character's features (qualities).Today, the Framler concept is a free application for Android and iOS, which opens up the following opportunities:- Riding a bike, tracking, saving, sharing and offering other users your routes- Get detailed information after the race (number of kilocalories, distance, distance uphill / distance downhill, maximum / average speed, information about comparing your statistics with the statistics of other players of your level, information about the movement in the championship tables of players who are near you, statistics the total distance compared to moving between different cities, the statistics of calories spent in comparison with kilocalories in different foods and much more!)- Earn levels by getting more daily time (the main value in Framler is available daily time. The higher the level, the more daily time is available). The higher the level, the more power-ups and equipment available.- Participate in four open championships (for beginning try to focus on the city championship, but automatically you'll participate in three others championships )- Participate in seasonal championships (by prior requests)- Participate in PvP battles of two different types:- Win / buy / collect along the way (using augmented reality) one-time bonuses that help to increase overall statistics and thereby bring a new level faster- Win / buy / collect along the way (using augmented reality also) bike equipment that provides temporary or permanent improvements- Communicate with other participants / invite other participants in joint PvP races- Form clans, get your unique bonuses- Buy real equipment in various specialized online / offline stores and receive special unique bonuses- Once a year to participate in real (offline) competitions, receive real cool prizes- Receive internal cryptocurrency and exchange it for virtual and real stuff- And it's just cool to spend time on the bike, pumping your legs and your character (avatar)!In fact, you will transfer yourself as a cyclist to a virtual world that is directly connected to the real world. It will really change your perception of cycling. So far, no one else can offer anything like this. Not to mention the unique features available only in Framler.Any user, from 16 years old, who has a smartphone. Both amateurs and pros.Currently, only professional athletes have the opportunity to compete in international competitions. Our application will allow to join in the local and international competition absolutely all the cyclists who wish it. No special trainings or selection of cyclists needed. By installing the app, you automatically become a participant in exciting competitions.ALL NEXT BONUSES WILL BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER INSTALLING THE FRAMLER, both in the open beta and the first stable release (for other users, bonuses will begin to open one after another from the fifth level)- According to our assumptions, the average user will use from two to five bonuses per month, i.e. 1.5-4 euros as maximum. Just the average price of one cup of coffee per month.- Of course every user can ride without the bonuses! They are (bonuses) just a way to reach a new level a little faster and a little more diverse. Moreover, almost all bonuses in the game can be earned and found absolutely free! You earn bonuses simply by riding on your own, participating in PvP battles, finding them on the street with the help of augmented reality, earning places in seasonal championships, fulfilling certain conditions and so on.Plus, buying the real bike uniforms (the certain equipment in your local offline or different online shops) you will earn unique bonuses and features (game skills) that will not be available in the list of ""standard"" bonuses / features in Framler.- Yes. As I said, riding, you can't not to earn bonuses for free. You will earn them anyway. But even without using them if they are available, you absolutely do not lose your competitive ability. In Framler, it all depends on your legs!This question need to be separated on two parts:1) buy it ""inside"" the Framler (as a ""standard"" user)2) or support the Framler now and receive the bonuses here? The answers are below.Most of the amount of money will be used for development (coding). We'll try to start coding the same time on iOS and Android.Coding: 75% (Android 45% / iOS 55%)Making t-shirts and USB flash drives: 12%Shipping: 5%Kickstarter fees:  5%Credit card processing fees:  3%Total: 100% ** (based on a €35,300 budget)I understand that for a hundred percent implementation of everything that is planned in Framler (for example, constant holding of local offline competitions with sponsorship of local sports shops, enterprises, etc.) this amount will be far from enough. I understand very well that this startup requires bigger investments in order to realize all its functions (offline) quickly.In this case, we will need offline Framler units, preferably in all major cities of each country where the competitions will be held. At least a representative office in the capitals of different countries. And at first all this requires huge investments both in time and in finance.The amount collected on Kickstarter is enough to develop all the basic functions, including the unique ones listed above.To implement all offline features of Framler, immediately after the establishment of the first stable version, we will try to find investors. Unfortunately, I am not a millionaire and I am not able to independently realize all those interesting ideas that Framler should incorporate.Yes. The plans are really grand.The final vision is to create a platform unparalleled in the world that will allow, in the form of play and competition, to unite tens of millions of cyclists in one big sports social network and make one big world online championship (this part can be done with the help of Kickstarter), and also to create a huge community with local offline competitions which will held in every big (and middle) city all over the world with the real cool prizes (this part can be done in two ways):But the answer is YES! The Framler will work even without the funds of investors. It will just take a little more time to implement all the features currently conceived.WE PLAN:1. We plan to create really new sports tracker with absolutely unique features2. We plan to unite ALL the cyclist in the world in one big world championship and who want to change a vision of classic cycling / who want to know what place they occupy among all the cyclists in the city - region - country - world / who want cycle and pump his health more effectively and with greater fun3. We plan to implement real offline stuffs which will affect different qualities / features of your avatar4. We plan to implement real offline competitions where absolutely everyone can feel himself as a procycler5. We plan to implement our own in-game cryptocurrency6. We plan to promote cycling in masses and help people in need with various sports equipment (in orphanages, children with disabilities, boarding schools, etc.)7. We plan to make a great fun for millions of cyclistWE HAVE:1. We already have 30% of the developed application2. All screen designs, structure & conception of how it all should work3. A great motivation, zeal & hard work4. The dream is to bring something cool, necessary and helping people.I hope I could explain at least a small fraction of what Framler can bring to the life of cyclists. If you have questions (and they certainly should appear!), please write in the comments. Let's create something really cool together! I wish you all good luck!Please visit us on FRAMLER.COM","In case of success on Kickstarter, we will start develop the Framler for two mobile platforms (Android & iOS) the same time. We plan to complete the stable version of Framler in April 2020 as maximum. Perhaps it will turn out even in March. The risk is that the process of writing code may not go evenly on Android and iOS. So it cannot be ruled out that on one OS Framler will start earlier, and on another a little later."

And everyone knows that an amp that you build with your own hands is, well, something that's uniquely yours.But tube amp kits cost a lot, they're hard to put together, and nobody but nerds can understand them. Which is why we're making Banana Jack Amps: all-tube, vintage-tone, easy-on-the-wallet, simple-to-assemble, crystal-clear guitar amp kits that can be put together WITHOUT SOLDERING.Easy to build.If you can plug a toaster in the wall, you can build your very own Banana Jack Amp.Our prototype kit consists of nine pre-assembled crystal-clear modules that you hook together, WITHOUT TOOLS, using color-coded banana hoses:Just plug and play. Really.Easy to understand.If you've read this far, you're bright enough to learn how it all works.Kenn Amdahl's delightful book, ""There Are No Electrons: Electronics for Earthlings"", is included with every kit:Combine that with our step-by-step instructions and life-size schematic diagrams that explain traditional nerd-squiggles in the same simple terms that Kenn uses......and add to that our crystal clear modules that you can take apart WITHOUT TOOLS so you can see all of the wee bits and pieces......and you've got an educational package that can't be beat. But suitable for use with your garage band, too: this is a real, vintage-tone, all-tube guitar amp, not a toy.Easy on the imagination.Using our modules, you can design and build the amp of your dreams. We'll be adding more modules to the collection as funds permit: tone controls, power amps with more watts, etc. Which means you can not only build your own amp, but design it as well. Mixing and matching just the modules you want. And putting them where you see fit in a cabinet of your own design (longer and shorter banana hoses are easily made, WITHOUT SOLDERING).Easy on the piggy bank.And with your help, we'll be able to do all that and more.And by more I mean less: specifically, get the price down to where a starving musician can afford it!So thanks for your time, your interest, and especially your support.Gerry RzeppaMake sure you check out our Project Updates to see what this is all about:","Frankly, this is a very low-risk project. You've seen and heard the prototype: it works! And I've been a self-employed entrepreneur all of my adult life (I'm 61 now). I've put together lots of projects that were at least as complex as this one (see my bio for some examples). I don't foresee any unusual problems this time around.What we need, to put it bluntly, is moolah. Parts that cost a buck and a half when we buy them one at a time can cost mere pennies in large quantities. And things that take hours to assemble, by hand, can be made in minutes once a proper assembly-line has been set up.So if we're going to get these kits to where our guitar-picking friends can afford them, we're going to need lots of the green stuff. Not for ourselves, but for tooling and for the vendors who will be supplying us with transformers, and tubes, and thousands of colorful little banana jacks.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1335354839/christian-song-bucket-list?ref=discovery_category_newest,1335354839/christian-song-bucket-list,"In the days of my youth I wrote and recorded an album of Christian songs.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/769138692/frozen-styph?ref=discovery_category_newest,769138692/frozen-styph,"	The audience-interactive comedy, Frozen Styph, first cracked that imaginary fourth wall between theater-goers and performers in the late 1980s. Produced as a dinner theater in Greenwich Village, it was not long before its wacky premise, its engaging characters, and its promise of hysterically funny audience-performer interactions attracted busload after busload of enthusiastic theater-goers.  All of these audience members came with the expectation that they were not only going to see a most unique show, but if they chose to participate, they could be part of it.  In short, from its inception, Frozen Styph has provided its audiences with the laughter that comes from watching a live performance of a scripted comedy, plus the opportunity to participate in hilarious improvisation. In performance after performance, this unique interactive comedy theater experience would yield truly magical and memorable evenings for both audience members and the actors. This was all the more magical given the fact that Frozen Styph is a show that is never the same twice. The only thing that does remain the same, performance after performance, is the motivation of the cast and crew to artfully blend scripted and improvised comedy to produce something funny and memorable--all the way to the point of magical. The premise of the show is that frozen foods king Max Styph had himself frozen.  Audience members arrive and are immediately treated by the staff and cast members as guests of Max Styph’s “memorial dinner party.” A large, smoking, cryonic chamber (presumably containing Max) is on the dais. Guests are seated at tables, some of which include planted cast members. At the tables, guests are asked to complete a “Memory of Max” form in which they state (or more accurately, make up) what their relationship to Max was.  There is also space for them to recall a memory of him.  Audience members who, for whatever reason, do not wish to be a participant in the show, are encouraged not to complete the form.  In this way, interactive theater remains interactive only for those guests who wish to be a part of the show.  Guests who prefer not to participate indicate that preference by not completing the ""Memory of Max"" form.     The “Memory of Max” forms are collected and used by the “Rabbi” officiating at the service to compose his eulogy of Max.  For the Rabbi role, we have in the past experimented with casting a variety of different ethnic types.  So, for example, in a New York production we used a Puerto Rican rabbi, and in a California production we used a Mexican rabbi.  The rabbi in the film, Frozen Styph, was Irish.  Regardless of his or her ethnicity, the Rabbi will delight live audiences with a sprinkling of Jewish humor and “yiddishisms” (like saying, “L’Chaim!” before taking a swig from a concealed flask). Some of the best “Rabbis” cast in that role have had a background in stand-up comedy.  To envision why this formula works so well, just think of your favorite stand-up comedian.  Now, imagine that comedian in the role of a Rabbi interacting with audience members as they share memories about a person who has had himself frozen.        As the evening progresses, a picture of Max emerges. Interestingly, given the input from varied audience members, no two pictures of Max will be quite the same; and that's part of the fun. The show ends with a surprise twist--a twist which, by now, may be no surprise to the audience members, especially since the book, Frozen Styph was published. Of course, it doesn’t matter that people know how it all ends.  Proof of that observation comes in the form of the dozens of people who have seen the show and then come back to see it again. Because this is Kickstarter, and because we are requesting funds from theater angels, let’s briefly discuss something that is veritable anathema to all creatives (including us): that is, the financial aspects of the show.  Frozen Styph is a relatively expensive show to produce.  This is so because it is designed to play to a relatively small house (about 100 audience members or less) and has a relatively large cast (13 people, give or take depending upon if a cast member or two doubles-up). Contrast those numbers with many Broadway productions that can have many hundreds of seats to sell per performance. To boot, it is difficult to charge Broadway ticket prices for local or regionally produced shows, even if the show is a proven winner, and even if the show includes dinner.  Experience has taught us that Frozen Styph works best as a dinner theater. Accordingly, we need to add the cost of dinner to other base costs such as rehearsal space rental, performance space rental, reservations and ticketing expenses and all of the many expenses to be listed below.  In the past, we have found that most restaurants we have done the show in (whether the famous Sardi's in New York's theater district, or Garvin's in Greenwich Village where the show began) require a minimum guarantee in terms of number of dinners served per performance. If that number is, say, 20 dinners, and each dinner (including tax and tip for the staff) is, say, $40, our “break-even” just on meals for every performance (not including the myriad other expenses) is $800. Tangentially, let's note that one possibility we have considered is serving microwavable (so-called “TV”) dinners and advertising that fact by calling the venue, “The Frozen Dinner Theater.”  It certainly would be attention-getting and might even have the effect of lessening our advertising, promotion, and publicity budget. But let’s put the frozen dinner idea on a “back burner” for the moment and get back to a listing of expenses associated with the show, and why we need theater angels to put it up.	Many actors will initially work for low or no pay, just for the privilege of working.  This can and is done in many non-union productions.  On its face, it seems like a win-win for all concerned.  Actors get to work and get exposure, and producers lower their labor costs.  Experience has taught us that such a situation is viable, but only when the actors are relatively self-sufficient and have their bills covered.  That is, if the actor is financially independent or if the actor has someone else (like a spouse) footing the household bills, the actor can willingly accept, at least for a trial period, a low pay or no pay arrangement.  However, the low pay/no pay situation does not work when actors have to worry about whether they are going to have enough gas to make it to a rehearsal or a performance.  Certainly over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the company’s esprit de corps without paying actors.       We anticipate that cast, understudies, crew, and front and back office staff will number about 20 people.  This includes a keyboardist present at each performance to create various moods using a portable, electric organ.  Even if each member of the company was paid a modest $50 per performance, just for the sake of example, that would amount to another one thousand dollars or so in expenses before the curtain rose on a nightly basis (not that we have a curtain, but you get the idea). Now, just between minimum meal guarantees to the restaurant hosting the show, and (minimal) salaries for cast and crew, our cost before that proverbial curtain rises is approaching two thousand dollars per performance. At that rate, and with the other costs cited below factored in, we will have to fill most of the seats in the house, most every performance to turn a profit.	Add to the previously cited expenses the cost of props (a one-time charge to construct the cryonic chamber, as well as some other props), “Memory of Max” forms printed for every performance (with a golf pencil for each form on the table), programs printed for each performance (which can get costly), as well as an advertising and publicity budget (where the sky can be the limit and $1,000 per week is considered minimum), and one can see how quickly expenditures mount.  Of course, there may also be professional costs including but not limited to production accounting costs, legal costs (to draw-up contracts with everyone), and the cost of production insurance.  Thankfully, we do not anticipate wardrobe costs (as cast members wear their own street clothes), set construction costs (all we really need for the show to work is a cryonic chamber), or lighting costs (which we really do not need in most settings).  However, even without these latter costs, Frozen Styph is a relatively expensive show to put-up.  Finally, because we are raising funds on Kickstarter, and because we sincerely value the theater angels who believe in the show enough to invest in it, we will be giving away some nice, postage-paid rewards, that must also be factored into our production budget.  Take a look at the list of rewards and you will see that at the upper levels, in particular, backers have the opportunity to score a lot of tickets to the show.  Of course, that is how it should be and it is our privilege and pleasure to “give back to backers.” Most people who get involved in professional theater do not do so to get rich.  They do so because they love what they do and they are driven by the passion to do it. Certainly we fit into that category. The $18,720 we are requesting in Kickstarter funds is truly the barest minimum needed to initiate the project. We sincerely hope there are some generous theater angels around who see the merit in this project and who want to be a part of the ""Styph family."" Getting this show funded on Kickstarter will be nothing short of sublime for all concerned--cast, crew, staff, and audience members. Getting the show over-funded above our minimal goal will amount to a state described in Yiddish as a ""machia"" (technically translated as ""pleasure"" but something more). It is our hope that we will be able to share the live, Frozen Styph experience with a new generation.  Then again, because the show is being put-up in South Florida, we might also to have share it with ""the old"" generation; you know, your parents’, grandparents’, and great grandparents’ generation. Instead of a late show on Saturday night, we might have to consider an ""early bird special."" But all of that suits us just fine; we anticipate that many of our backers will have family and friends in South Florida who they will be sending to the show. Backers and guests of backers will always get special attention. They will not be seated, for example, near the defibrillator station. We understand how distracting it can be to try and watch a show with someone periodically yelling, ""Clear!"" Whenever the show is fully funded on Kickstarter, we will begin the process of putting it up (that is obtaining rehearsal space and performance space, auditioning actors, etc.). Our goal is to prepare for a three-month run beginning some time in December, 2015.   Advertising, promotion, and publicity will commence in earnest in November, 2015.  We believe December will be a great time to open because of the presence of many “snowbirds” who make South Florida their home for the winter. So, dear backers, if you live in or plan to visit South Florida this coming winter, or if you have family or friends living in South Florida, watch your e-mail for announcements from us regarding show dates and times. Check out our rewards and you'll see that it takes as little as a contribution of $500 to score tickets and an invitation to our premiere party. In the Kickstarter promo video, we used clips from the Frozen Styph movie. A brief word of explanation is in order... With the success of the play, Frozen Styph, Ronald Jay Cohen wrote a book and a script for a film, Frozen Styph with the same title. Rather than simply being a reproduction of the play, the objective of both the film and the book was to tell some of the back story to the play; why did Max have himself frozen? The book begins at the time of the memorial dinner party, and flashes back to events in Max's life. The film begins two years before Scott's Bar Mitzvah and it takes us through all the challenges of trying to plan such an event, only to have everything go wrong in the end. Independently financed and produced by Gold Palms Feature Films and not yet released, the original plan for Frozen Styph (the film) was to release it in the form of 18 episodes on youtube. However, the producers are currently considering various alternative distribution options. In the meantime, the trailers for each of the 18 episodes of the film have been, and remain, posted on youtube. Potential backers of Frozen Styph (the play) may wish to visit The Styph Channel on youtube to watch some or all of these trailers. For the most part, the content of the trailers (other than the content that depicts Max's memorial dinner party) is not representative of the content of the play. An exception is Episode 18 which does contain some footage from the live show.  Viewing this and all of the trailers may be helpful in previewing whether the humor featured is personally appealing and worth backing. Keep in mind, that the comedy experience of the live show can be multiplied several fold given the talent of the actors, and the disposition of the audience members.","RISKS AND CHALLENGES     After the project is successfully funded, the work begins.  Challenges include finding an appropriate venue for the dinner theater, publishing casting notices, building the cryonic chamber and obtaining other props, having various legal agreements drawn-up, arranging for reservation and ticketing mechanisms, and myriad other pre-production ""to do's.""  Perhaps the greatest challenge will be to cast gifted actors who possess not only superlative acting ability, but skill in improvisation. Experience tells us that it is not easy to find these folks... but they are out there.  A related challenge has to do with making the entire production gel as a team.  Here our task is to create a production company culture where the passion to exceed audience expectation is shared by all and over-riding.      When mounting the show in New York, a challenge we faced was holding on to talented actors for the full run of the show.  This is understandable given that all actors are constantly trying to advance their careers and in New York, one could go on auditions on an almost daily basis.  When an audition for a role in some major production or feature film bore fruit for the actor, it was difficult for us to deny them the opportunity to accept it (contract or no contract).  We trust that we will not have the same sort of actor retention issues in South Florida, and in any case will seek a firm commitment from the actors for at least a three-month run of the show.     The only other creative project that Cracked Wall Comedy Theater (CWCT) is currently engaged in is post-production on the film, Frozen Styph, as well as the consideration of several distribution options for that film.  We confidently anticipate that none of this will in any way distract us from our goal of bringing Frozen Styph (the play) to South Florida.      In sum, since this is not our ""first rodeo,"" and since we first pioneered interactive theater over two decades ago, the CWCT staff feel more than prepared to deal with any and all challenges as they arise.  Experience is a great teacher, and there is no doubt that with each production of the show that we have mounted,  we have gotten better at preparing for and dealing with problems and potential setbacks.  Backers should be 100% confident that once we are fully funded, ""the show will go on,"" hopefully, without a hitch.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/769138692/mitzvah?ref=discovery_category_newest,769138692/mitzvah,"Dear Backer: This is a project that truly deserves to be funded. Here are 2 powerful reasons why: 1) It's a feature film that is practically completed. As you will see, there is no mystery about casting, whether the actors can act, whether the scenes will be filmed, etc. etc. It's all there--well, mostly there--for you to see. So, unlike most other Kickstarter projects in the film/video category, you have the advantage of being able to judge for yourself the potential of this film in terms of how funny it is, how appealing the characters are, and so forth. We hope that you will share our view that this film, with proper post-production and other enhancements, has the potential to be an iconic Bar Mitzvah comedy. 2) The #2 reason that you should consider backing this film is that Mitzvah! is a comedy that is really funny. Finding a comedy that is actually funny should not be a rare, remarkable event. But truth be told, a true scarcity of true comedy exists. When was the last time you saw a film billed as a comedy and truly laughed out loud? Sad to say, many--too many--projects billed as comedies, both in the video/film and the theater category, aren't all that funny. When one finds a comedy film or play that is truly funny, that property is referred to as a ""gem."" May we humbly suggest that if you are reading this right now, that you have, in fact, discovered a gem. And speaking of gems, Cracked Wall Comedy Theater (CWCT) has another gem for you to consider in the Kickstarter Theater project listings. We mention that here because our theater project in the theater section (Frozen Styph) may be thought of as ""the father"" of Mitzvah! That is, the main characters in that popular play are the same as in the film. However, Mitzvah! is set about 12 years before the events in the play.  In this sense, the film is a prequel to the events in the play. Additional explanation follows below. Mitzvah! is a comedy about a Bar Mitzvah where, after years of planning and preparation, nothing goes as planned. Mitzvah! begins about two years before Scott Styph's Bar Mitzvah, and finds Scott's parents, Olga and Max Styph, interviewing caterers and going through all of the other rituals and preparation necessary for this momentous event in the life of their son. Although Mitzvah! stands on its own with its absorbing story and engaging characters, the film provides the back story to Ronald Jay Cohen's Frozen Styph. For readers unfamiliar with this pioneering audience-interactive comedy theater experience, Frozen Styph, was first produced in New York's Greenwich Village in the late 1980s. The premise of the show was that frozen foods king Max Styph had himself frozen. Theater-goers who came to the show could be part of it if they so desired; they created roless for themselves in Max's life, and proceeded to deliver ""eulogies"" of Max based on those roles.  In Mitzvah!, which takes place 12 years before Max was frozen, we begin to understand why Max did what he did. By the way, for more information about the ""father"" of the Mitzvah! project, check out our Kickstarter Frozen Styph pitch in the ""Theater"" section. As we have already noted, the beauty of being a backer of Mitzvah! is that there will be no mystery about the script, the story, the characters, the casting, or whether or not the movie will ever actually be shot. That is because, all of that has been done; most of the film is ""in the can"" as they say. As we flirted with episodic distribution of the film in the form of 18 youtube installments, we changed the title of Mitzvah! to Frozen Styph and posted 18 trailers on youtube for each of the episodes. These previews, which run on average, 2 minutes each, and are currently titled ""Frozen Styph"" on youtube, tell the Mitzvah! story. For your convenience, links to all of the trailers are presented below. Still unpublished, are the 18 full-length episodes, which each run, on average, about 10 minutes each. If we do the math, that's approximately 180 minutes of content that we need to edit down, and supplement with new footage to produce a feature of approximately 90 minutes or so. Actually, we have about twice that in raw, never used footage... but who's counting? The edited and supplemented footage will be used to create a feature comedy about a Bar Mitzvah. And Voila! That feature comedy will be titled: Mitzvah! Most projects need to be kickstarted to begin. For the most part, these projects have a lot of risk attached to them as there are so many variables that can go south. Our project is different. We have already done the heavy lifting, the casting, the filming, and most of the financing. But the film needs a little more work to bring it to completion. We are asking for Kickstarter funding to finish, not begin this project. Kickstarter funds will be used to take CWCT staff back into the studio, to professionally edit or enhance video and audio. There are substantial hourly fees for such post-production work. These fees are for personnel time and for studio rental. We also anticipate that we will have to supplement footage that we have already shot with some new footage. Again, there will be substantial costs associated with that as well. Another use of the funds raised will be to obtain synchronization licenses for some music that we would like to add, There are also costs associated with obtaining and legally closing a deal with a distributor (or, should we choose to do so, distributing the film ourselves).  Of course, since we are giving away rewards to Kickstarter backers--modest as those rewards might be--we must budget for those costs as well.  All things considered, $36,000 to produce what will be the funniest feature film about a Bar Mitzvah ever made may seem like a lot of money. However, by film standards, it is not. This figure is probably a fraction of just the catering budget for other major motion pictures comedies that tried to tackle the same topic as us (but were not nearly as successful, in our opinion). We invite potential backers of the film to watch the brief previews of the film currently called ""Frozen Styph"" that are posted on youtube. Compare the content to any other comedy about a Bar Mitzvah that you have ever seen. We think that you will find that there is no comparison. So now it is up to you, and the future of Mitzvah! is in your hands. We hope that you will take advantage of a relatively rare opportunity when it comes to the backing of a film. The opportunity to judge for yourself from filmed samples whether this is a film that you would like to see. Do the same thing for our complementary Kickstarter project, Frozen Styph, which is another hidden gem (buried somewhere in the theater listings). Ask yourself, is this a theater experience I might enjoy? Is this the type of theater that I would look forward to going to with family and friends to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, or some other occasion? If the answer to these questions is an enthusiastic,""yes,"" please consider ""joining the Styph family"" and helping to (enthusiastically) back these two deserving projects. It may be a little confusing, so let's review.Once upon a time, Ronald Jay Cohen wrote a very funny, audience-interactive play called Frozen Styph. Based on the characters created in the play, Cohen scripted a film that served as the back story to the play. The film was originally titled, ""Mitzvah!"" It was then serialized into 18 episodes, re-titled, FROZEN STYPH: THE FILM and prepared for release on youtube. In preparation for that release, trailers for all of the 18 episodes were posted on The Styph Channel on youtube. However, as the producers considered various distribution alternatives, the 18 full-length episodes of the film were never released. The current plan is to re-edit the film, shoot new footage, and do whatever else that needs to be done to make Mitzvah! an iconic Bar Mitzvah comedy film. So, now, please take the opportunity to meet Max Styph, Olga Styph, Jennifer Styph, and the Bar Mitzvah boy, Scott Styph, in Ronald Jay Cohen's, MITZVAH!Episode 1  Episode 2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12 Episode 13Episode 14 Episode 15Episode 16Episode 17 Episode 18 FROZEN STYPH Trailer “A” FROZEN STYPH Trailer “B”Kickstarter video for FROZEN STYPH theater projectKickstarter video for MITZVAH! film project","Risks and ChallengesIf we were just starting out on this journey, a long list of risks and challenges could realistically be compiled.  The good news, however, is that given where we are today, there really are no significant risks and challenges.Once we finish the film, perhaps the greatest challenge will be to obtain a distributor.  The greatest risk is that we will not get a deal with a distributor, or that we will not a good deal with a distributor.  Our contingency plan will be to explore self-distribution, as well as  placement with various potential outlets for filmed entertainment.       Regardless of the outcome of our search for a distributor, once the Kickstarter project is fully funded and the Mitzvah! film is finished, there will be a date set for our premiere party.  Accordingly, our Backers can be confident that they will receive all of the rewards promised.  The only exception here is the reward of tickets to the Frozen Styph (Theater) premiere party.  As we mentioned in the description of this particular reward, Frozen Styph (our project listed in the Kickstarter theater section) must be fully funded if we are to distribute tickets for the play's premiere.       Understandably, some potential backers who read both this project description, as well as our Frozen Styph project description (in Theater), may ask, ""How can you do both?""  Of course, there is clearly a risk associated with taking on two projects within the same time window.  However, we believe that the risk in this case is small. We have produced Frozen Styph, the play, several times, and have the know-how to produce it efficiently again.  With regard to the film, Mitzvah!, most of it has been shot, and all that remains for completion is some additional shooting and post-production. The time window (over six months) is more than adequate for 100% effort on each project. A theater director will be assigned to direct and supervise the live theater project, while another member of our creative team, will supervise the re-editing and re-shooting of Mitzvah!  In terms of rewards due our backers, the two projects are probably more complementary than they are competitive in terms of demands on staff time.  This is so because the goods sent to backers are the same or similar (cards, DVDs, books, tee shirts, and invitations to premiere parties) for each project.  In terms of economy of costs and of time, it will be more efficient for CWCT to order all of the tee shirts and any other rewards at one time, rather than on separate occasions.       So... can we count on you to help make Mitzvah!, the film, happen?  What about Frozen Styph (see the Kickstarter Theater section)? Help us bring the Styphs to life to the delight of many!Thank you very much for your consideration and help, in advance."
